 radical_deluge_new_bureaucracy: "Новая бюрократия"
 radical_deluge_new_bureaucracy_desc: "The old order is ended and its officials will never accommodate themselves to our rule. We must train a new generation of bureaucrats, completely dedicated to the ideals of the revolution."
 radical_deluge_old_bureaucracy: "Реконструкция"
 radical_deluge_old_bureaucracy_desc: "The officials of the old order are not totally lost to us. We can make use of their talents, assuming they adopt the correct political attitudes."
 radical_deluge_communes: "Сельские коммуны"
 radical_deluge_communes_desc: "A system of communal ownership of land, wherein each household gets its own individual plots, land is periodically re-allocated on the basis of a census, to ensure equitable share of the land. The communes also act as a village government and a cooperative owning shared mechanical tools."
 radical_deluge_collectives: "Коллективы"
 radical_deluge_collectives_desc: "We will gather the inefficient peasant farmers into larger units to specialise and simplify the functions of each peasant, in order to run our agriculture with division of labour and economies of scale."
 radical_deluge_cooperatives: "Кооперативы"
 radical_deluge_cooperatives_desc: "By giving the ordinary farmers and workers more control over their consumption of goods, the market will be harnessed for the benefit of the people, and not the profits of a small minority."
 radical_deluge_political_purge: "Политическая очистка"
 radical_deluge_political_purge_desc: "We still feel the insidious influence of the old order, seeping into the thoughts and actions of once-loyal comrades.\n'Terror without which virtue is impotent, virtue without which terror is destructive.'"
 radical_deluge_glasnost: "Гласность"
 radical_deluge_glasnost_desc: "Political openness and transparency are key for a stable government. If the people lose faith in us, we are doomed."
 radical_deluge_universal_education: "Универсальное образование"
 radical_deluge_universal_education_desc: "Free and universal education has long been a basic demand of social reformers across the world. We are finally in a position to enact this policy and benefit the whole of society."
 radical_deluge_politburo: "Политбюро"
 radical_deluge_politburo_desc: "We need a central body of decision makers to make sense of the reams of information flowing into the government. This political bureau will be analogous to the cabinets and councils of the capitalist powers, but with ministers drawn from the revolutionary classes."
 radical_deluge_industrial_cartels: "Промышленные картели"
 radical_deluge_industrial_cartels_desc: "We can turn the multitude of small businesses into massive conglomerates that can dictate market prices domestically and even influence prices on the world market. In this way, we can rapidly expand our industrial base and bring much needed revenue into the state's coffers."
 radical_deluge_synarchism: "Синархия"
 radical_deluge_synarchism_desc: "The state bureaucracy is not like the omniscient demon of Laplace. The workers, consumers, suppliers and local government not only have better knowledge of the situation but also stakes in the harmonious functioning of the industry. So obviously they deserve to be represented in either a factory's management, the plan committee or both."
 radical_deluge_new_economic_policy: "Новая экономическая политика"
 radical_deluge_new_economic_policy_desc: "The circumstances force upon us a strategic retreat from state ownership. A regulated market and limited private ownership are necessary measures to allow ordinary people to enrich themselves and therefore make the country as a whole stronger."
 radical_deluge_party_run_courts: "Специальные трибуналы"
 radical_deluge_party_run_courts_desc: "The normal legal system has been overwhelmed by the number of cases it needs to adjudicate, with counter-revolutionaries and terrorists competing with petty criminals for time in court. By granting local Party leaders extraordinary abilities to quickly try and judge cases, we can clear the backlog and restore order."
 radical_deluge_independent_courts: "Независимые суды"
 radical_deluge_independent_courts_desc: "We must ensure that as few as possible innocents get hurt in a travesty of justice. If that means a few reactionaries will go free, then so be it."
 radical_deluge_women_in_the_workforce: "Женщины держат половину неба"
 radical_deluge_women_in_the_workforce_desc: "The status of women up to now has been compared to that of a serf; women have been tied to the home, and only socialism can save them from this."
 radical_deluge_housing_collectives: "Жилищные коллективы"
 radical_deluge_housing_collectives_desc: "The devastation of the recent wars and upheavels has left huge segments of the population homeless or displaced as refugees. Prefabricated concrete apartment blocks may be drab and uniform, but beauty comes second to meeting basic needs."
 radical_deluge_state_run_press: "Государственная пресса"
 radical_deluge_state_run_press_desc: "The intellectuals have their place in the revolution, of course, but the working class is now the driving engine of social progress. The state must carefully guide journalists to report only the essential truth, not arbitrary 'facts' which can be manipulated to serve our enemies."
 radical_deluge_censorship: "Цензура"
 radical_deluge_censorship_desc: "The state has more important concerns than running printing presses. We are doing good work and should encourage the journalists to report on this, within reason. Espionage and defeatism are of course counter-revolutionary activities that will be curtailed." 
 radical_deluge_great_leap_forwards: "Большой скачок вперед"
 radical_deluge_great_leap_forwards_desc: "Our precarious situation requires that we reduce our reliance on imports and instead produce equipment and weapons domestically. The only feasible way to do this is by reducing domestic consumption to fund more factories."
 radical_deluge_attract_foreign_credit: "Привлечение иностранного кредита"
 radical_deluge_attract_foreign_credit_desc: "Our precarious situation requires that we reduce our reliance on imports and instead produce equipment and weapons domestically. The only feasible way to do this is by seeking foreign credit to fund more factories."
 radical_deluge_autonomy_for_minorities: "Автономия меньшинств"
 radical_deluge_autonomy_for_minorities_desc: "We must undo the policies of the previous regime which greatly harmed our country's regional dialects and destroyed the culture of its oppressed nations."
 radical_deluge_assimilate_minorities: "Ассимиляция меньшинств"
 radical_deluge_assimilate_minorities_desc: "Minority groups demand special privileges from the Fatherland which we can ill afford to grant. If their particularisms are tolerated, they will never overcome their isolation and will remain backwards economically and socially. We must help them overcome these difficulties."
 radical_deluge_social_patriotism: "Социальный патриотизм"
 radical_deluge_social_patriotism_desc: "The world has abandoned us! We fight alone against an insidious enemy, an enemy who would destroy the Fatherland, who would have our nation crumble from within! But we are strong enough to fight the invader - we are strong enough to prevail!"
 radical_deluge_internationalism: "Интернационализм"
 radical_deluge_internationalism_desc: "The reactionary bandits are swarming and all citizens of the socialist Fatherland must rally to the defence of the worker's state! We need to gather fraternal republics to our cause, for mutual defence and for carrying assaults into the hives and lairs of the enemy!"
 radical_deluge_architects: "Архитекторы"
 radical_deluge_architects_desc: "Who would have thought that designing factories was a full time job? We need experts in the field of architecture and industrial processes to create the backbone of our economy. Train them, hire them, or kidnap them!"
 radical_deluge_production_lines: "Производственные линии"
 radical_deluge_production_lines_desc: "Artisanal production is quaint, charming, artistic, and will doom our nation to military defeat. Specialisation of tools and training will increase productivity and put more rifles in the hands of the troops."
 radical_deluge_time_and_motion: "Исследования времени и движения"
 radical_deluge_time_and_motion_desc: "Bottlenecks in production can form from badly planned industrial processes. Machines and skilled workers should always be doing something useful, not standing idle and watching paint dry. We need our plant managers to learn how to minimise bottlenecks."
 radical_deluge_synthetic_oils: "Синтетическая нефть"
 radical_deluge_synthetic_oils_desc: "The war machine is insatiable! We need oil to run engines, and rubber for seals and wheels. We can resort to chemical processes if we can't find the natural resources we would prefer to use."
 radical_deluge_resource_efficiency: "Эффективность ресурсов"
 radical_deluge_resource_efficiency_desc: "Both during extraction and in putting materials to use, we need to make sure we are stretching our resources to their maximum extent. The idea that functionality should trump appearance is something easy to agree to in principle, but harder to implement."
 radical_deluge_develop_steel: "Развитие металлургической промышленности"
 radical_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 radical_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Продвинутые сплавы"
 radical_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 radical_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Ископаемое топливо"
 radical_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 radical_deluge_infrastructure: "Инфраструктура"
 radical_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 radical_deluge_civilian_industry: "Субсидировать гражданскую индустрию"
 radical_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 radical_deluge_military_industry: "Расширить военную промышленность"
 radical_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 radical_deluge_more_industry: "Программа общественных работ"
 radical_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 radical_deluge_electronics_research: "Исследования электроники"
 radical_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 radical_deluge_radar_research: "Электромагнитные исследования"
 radical_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 radical_deluge_encryption_research: "Исследование шифрования"
 radical_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 radical_deluge_electronics_industry: "Электронная промышленность"
 radical_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 radical_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Военно-промышленный комплекс"
 radical_deluge_military_industrial_complex_desc: "'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.'"
 radical_deluge_war_machine: "Военная машина"
 radical_deluge_war_machine_desc: "'Petroleum poisons Capital with absolute madness, a planetary plague bleeding into economies mobilised by the technological singularities of advanced civilisations.'"
 radical_deluge_production_management_agency: "Агентство управления производством"
 radical_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."
 radical_deluge_land_management_agency: "Агентство землеустройства"
 radical_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 radical_deluge_public_works_agency: "Агентство общественных работ"
 radical_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 radical_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Агентство оборонных исследований"
 radical_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 radical_deluge_league_ratification: "Ратификация Лиги Наций"
 radical_deluge_league_ratification_desc: "The member states have voted on the Conventions and we can now begin implementing the proposals which passed."
 radical_deluge_league_economic_research: "Программа экономической помощи"
 radical_deluge_league_economic_research_desc: "We can help ensure peace and stability by enriching our people and our neighbours. We should be open about developments in industry and electronics."
 radical_deluge_league_leave: "Выйти из Лиги Наций"
 radical_deluge_league_leave_desc: "Perhaps it was too utopian to think we could settle our differences when surrounded by such hateful enemies. We should end our participation in the League of Nations."
 radical_deluge_tech_sharing: "Совет экономической взаимопомощи"
 radical_deluge_tech_sharing_desc: "Let us participate in a Council for Mutual Economic Assistance between all the fraternal republics of our International. We will share our research with our comrades and in doing so help spread the revolution!"
 radical_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Морская инфраструктура"
 radical_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 radical_deluge_naval_expansion: "Военно-морское экспансия"
 radical_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 radical_deluge_new_ship_roles: "Новые роли корабля"
 radical_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 radical_deluge_naval_academy: "Морская академия"
 radical_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 radical_deluge_innovative_navy: "Инновационный флот"
 radical_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 radical_deluge_traditional_navy: "Традиционный флот"
 radical_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 radical_deluge_naval_exercises: "Военно-морские учения"
 radical_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 radical_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Уроки Великой Войны"
 radical_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 radical_deluge_weapon_advances: "Достижения в области оружия"
 radical_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 radical_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Нация по оружию"
 radical_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 radical_deluge_standing_army: "Регулярная армия"
 radical_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 radical_deluge_artillery_advances: "Достижения в области артиллерии"
 radical_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 radical_deluge_offensive_army: "Наступательная армия"
 radical_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 radical_deluge_defensive_army: "Оборонительная армия"
 radical_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 radical_deluge_support_brigades: "Поддержка бригад"
 radical_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 radical_deluge_new_training_regimes: "Новые тренировочные режимы"
 radical_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 radical_deluge_specialist_roles: "Роли специалиста"
 radical_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 radical_deluge_marines: "Морпехи и морская пехота"
 radical_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 radical_deluge_paratroopers: "Парашютные и авиационные подразделения"
 radical_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 radical_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Маневренная война"
 radical_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 radical_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Бронированная война"
 radical_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 radical_deluge_field_exercises: "Полевые учения"
 radical_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 radical_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Авиационная промышленность"
 radical_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 radical_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Авиационные материалы"
 radical_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 radical_deluge_army_airforce: "Автономный военно-воздушный флот"
 radical_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 radical_deluge_flight_schools: "Летные школы"
 radical_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
 germany_radical_deluge_new_bureaucracy: "Новая бюрократия"
 germany_radical_deluge_new_bureaucracy_desc: "The old order is ended and its officials will never accommodate themselves to our rule. We must train a new generation of bureaucrats, completely dedicated to the ideals of the revolution."
 germany_radical_deluge_old_bureaucracy: "Реконструкция"

 germany_radical_deluge_develop_steel_desc: "Steel produces our guns, tanks and ships. We need more of it, we need it cheaper, and we need it of higher quality. Whether we are importing the iron or digging it up ourselves, more steel mills will be needed for victory in the field."
 germany_radical_deluge_advanced_alloys: "Продвинутые сплавы"
 germany_radical_deluge_advanced_alloys_desc: "Chromium is alloyed with steel or nickel to make a metal that is vastly more resistant to corrosion and extreme heat, vital for blast furnaces and aircraft engines. Tungsten, on the other hand, makes steel much tougher, and is used for armour piercing ammunition that relies on kinetic penetration. We need both metals!"
 germany_radical_deluge_fossil_fuels: "Ископаемое топливо"
 germany_radical_deluge_fossil_fuels_desc: "One of the bottlenecks in smelting bauxite into aluminium is the electricity needed for the Bayer process. The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to build coal-fired power plants. We should therefore hunt for more fossil fuels."
 germany_radical_deluge_infrastructure: "Инфраструктура"
 germany_radical_deluge_infrastructure_desc: "The transport infrastructure is often a bottleneck, in both industrial processes and military deployment. Developing our rail and road connexions is a high priority, if unglamorous."
 germany_radical_deluge_civilian_industry: "Субсидировать гражданскую индустрию"
 germany_radical_deluge_civilian_industry_desc: "Consumer goods factories and the construction industry are valuable in themselves for the welfare of the people, but they can also be quickly converted for military purposes."
 germany_radical_deluge_military_industry: "Расширить военную промышленность"
 germany_radical_deluge_military_industry_desc: "Tanks and rifles can't be put together in a shed! Well, they can be, but not in sufficient quantities to defend our nation and interests. We should aim for more military factories."
 germany_radical_deluge_more_industry: "Программа общественных работ"
 germany_radical_deluge_more_industry_desc: "The economy still needs to adapt to the post-Great War environment. Many goods have increased in value while others are no longer commercially viable. This is a great opportunity to build up our industrial base and reduce unemployment."
 germany_radical_deluge_electronics_research: "Исследования электроники"
 germany_radical_deluge_electronics_research_desc: "Research is advancing extremely quickly in the field of electronics. New computators which rely on electronic rather than mechanical inputs are being invented, although they are as yet still in their infancy. We should investigate the applications of electronics for national defence."
 germany_radical_deluge_radar_research: "Электромагнитные исследования"
 germany_radical_deluge_radar_research_desc: "Detecting enemy forces before they arrive would be a wonderful boon for our armies. There are many avenues for further research in the field of electromagnetic waves."
 germany_radical_deluge_encryption_research: "Исследование шифрования"
 germany_radical_deluge_encryption_research_desc: "When data is transmitted by radio, there is no telling who is listening. The possibility of learning the enemy's secrets without him realising is a tantalising prospect."
 germany_radical_deluge_electronics_industry: "Электронная промышленность"
 germany_radical_deluge_electronics_industry_desc: "The many applications for electronics we have discovered need to be translated into production, which means factories and a civilian workforce."
 germany_radical_deluge_military_industrial_complex: "Военно-промышленный комплекс"
 germany_radical_deluge_military_industrial_complex_desc: "'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.'"
 germany_radical_deluge_war_machine: "Военная машина"
 germany_radical_deluge_war_machine_desc: "'Petroleum poisons Capital with absolute madness, a planetary plague bleeding into economies mobilised by the technological singularities of advanced civilisations.'"
 germany_radical_deluge_production_management_agency: "Агентство по управлению производством"
 germany_radical_deluge_production_management_agency_desc: "Our government procures huge amounts of war materiel and it must all be produced to specific standards. We need an agency in charge of procurement and quality assurance."
 germany_radical_deluge_land_management_agency: "Агентство землеустройства"
 germany_radical_deluge_land_management_agency_desc: "The untapped natural resources of our country must be carefully managed and exploited for the maximum benefit of the war effort."
 germany_radical_deluge_public_works_agency: "Агентство общественных работ"
 germany_radical_deluge_public_works_agency_desc: "The unemployed masses are a threat to our stability but also a great opportunity. We will make use of the idle young men in need of purpose by constructing all manner of public works."
 germany_radical_deluge_defence_research_agency: "Агентство оборонных исследований"
 germany_radical_deluge_defence_research_agency_desc: "Our experimental research scientists have made great strides in many areas, and we think they have even more wonderful advances ahead of them. We need an agency to turn blue skies thinking into mushroom clouds."
 germany_radical_deluge_league_ratification: "Ратификация Лиги Наций"
 germany_radical_deluge_league_ratification_desc: "The member states have voted on the Conventions and we can now begin implementing the proposals which passed."
 germany_radical_deluge_league_economic_research: "Программа экономической помощи"
 germany_radical_deluge_league_economic_research_desc: "We can help ensure peace and stability by enriching our people and our neighbours. We should be open about developments in industry and electronics."
 germany_radical_deluge_league_leave: "Выйти из Лиги Наций"
 germany_radical_deluge_league_leave_desc: "Perhaps it was too utopian to think we could settle our differences when surrounded by such hateful enemies. We should end our participation in the League of Nations."
 germany_radical_deluge_tech_sharing: "Совет экономической взаимопомощи"
 germany_radical_deluge_tech_sharing_desc: "Let us participate in a Council for Mutual Economic Assistance between all the fraternal republics of our International. We will share our research with our comrades and in doing so help spread the revolution!"
 germany_radical_create_faction: "Агрессивная внешняя политика"
 germany_radical_create_faction_desc: "The disastrous Civil War is over and we can turn our attentions outwards. Germany must find allies to secure our interests abroad."
 germany_radical_claim_holland: "Претензии к Голландии"
 germany_radical_claim_holland_desc: "The West Rhineland region around Cologne was stolen from Germany by Napoleon and given to his Dutch puppet state. We do not need to trace the lineage of dynasties to know that this wrong must be righted. We must take back Cologne and punish the Dutch for their complicity."
 germany_radical_claim_france: "Претензии к Франции"
 germany_radical_claim_france_desc: "Long ago, Napoleon's bandit armies swarmed over the Meuse and looted the cultural heartlands of Germany. Bitburg, Kleve, Straßburg, Luxemburg and Trier were oppressed and frenchified. We must push the French back to the Meuse and reclaim our people's history."
 germany_radical_claim_austria: "Претензии к Австрии"
 germany_radical_claim_austria_desc: "The decrepit Habsburg monarchy was never meant to reach the modern era. It is a relic of the dark ages. All Germans must be united into one nation-state. We will finish what Napoleon started when he disbanded the Holy Roman Empire!"
 germany_radical_claim_poland: "Претензии к Польше"
 germany_radical_claim_poland_desc: "Silesia and Prussia were heartlands of the German tribes millenia ago. Though the Slavs expanded into them, the regions still have strong cultural ties with Germany. We must liberate the Germans in Poland from their subjugation."
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_infrastructure: "Морская инфраструктура"
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_infrastructure_desc: "The oceans remain the modern world's highway for most goods and resources. We need infrastructure in place to bring in raw materials with which to feed the war machine."
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_expansion: "Военно-морская экспансия"
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_expansion_desc: "Our enemies will seek to blockade our ports and starve our people of food and our industries of resources. We must contest the seas in order to secure the independence of our nation."
 germany_radical_deluge_new_ship_roles: "Новые роли корабля"
 germany_radical_deluge_new_ship_roles_desc: "Navies around the world experimented with new ship classes during the Great War. The carrier and submarine concepts should both be further investigated as they may be of use to our navy."
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_academy: "Морская академия"
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_academy_desc: "We need well trained naval officers who have initiative and knowledge in addition to courage and charisma. The most sophisticated battleship would be a worthless hulk without a crew capable of manning her."
 germany_radical_deluge_innovative_navy: "Инновационный флот"
 germany_radical_deluge_innovative_navy_desc: "The new roles we have reviewed are extremely disruptive to the conventional doctrine of warships pounding one another with large calibre guns. In fact, we would go as far as to say that the battleship as a concept is now obsolete. We should switch our entire focus to carriers, submarines and naval bombers."
 germany_radical_deluge_traditional_navy: "Традиционный флот"
 germany_radical_deluge_traditional_navy_desc: "Though the fleet air arm has demonstrated its usefulness, the bulk of naval warfare remains the purview of the conventional warship - whether escorts on anti-submarine duty, shore bombardment missions, or surface actions between rival fleets. We are not about to abandon centuries of hard-won experience."
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_exercises: "Морские учения"
 germany_radical_deluge_naval_exercises_desc: "Classrooms can only go so far in creating a credible navy. Real-world experience is vital for testing the training of crews and officers."
 germany_radical_deluge_great_war_lessons: "Уроки Великой Войны"
 germany_radical_deluge_great_war_lessons_desc: "The relative peace of the 'Long 19th Century' lulled armies into complacency and stagnation. In 1928, Napoleonic officers led their men blindly into the maws of a meat grinder. Our nation has survived, but we should rectify our recent mistakes."
 germany_radical_deluge_weapon_advances: "Достижения в области оружия"
 germany_radical_deluge_weapon_advances_desc: "The speed of technological advances in small arms has been remarkable. We have gone from muzzle loaded muskets to belt-fed machineguns in the space of a century. We must keep on top of these advances."
 germany_radical_deluge_nation-at-arms: "Нация по оружию"
 germany_radical_deluge_nation-at-arms_desc: "The Fatherland needs the whole of the people to come to its defence when threatened. War is far too important to be left to the generals, with their antiquated military ideas and conservative world-view. We need a patriotic militia of free citizens, not a glorified police force run by a secret society. The professionals in the army should only be there to train the conscripts in times of war."
 germany_radical_deluge_standing_army: "Регулярная армия"
 germany_radical_deluge_standing_army_desc: "Professionalism is increasingly important in these times of mechanisation and specialisation. A stable nation needs to be protected by a stable army. Political interference by leftists and anti-militarist traitors should be ignored - they have no idea about the true needs of the armed forces."
 germany_radical_deluge_artillery_advances: "Достижения в области артиллерии"
 germany_radical_deluge_artillery_advances_desc: "There are now a plethora of munitions for our logistics corps to worry over. We can fire armour-piercing rounds, high-explosive shells, incendiary phosphorous rounds, even poison gas. And of course, the guns keep getting bigger."
 germany_radical_deluge_offensive_army: "Наступательная армия"
 germany_radical_deluge_offensive_army_desc: "We cannot trust international institutions or the starvation of the enemy through blockade to secure our independence. If we want the enemy to surrender, we must reach out into his lands and strangle him. Loss of territory necessarily affects a nation's war potential, and this holds for both us and the enemy, so fighting on our own land is doubly pointless."
 germany_radical_deluge_defensive_army: "Оборонительная армия"
 germany_radical_deluge_defensive_army_desc: "Attack requires a threefold superiority in numbers to succeed, with a corresponding increase in casualties. We cannot afford this holocaust. Let the enemy pile up their dead in front of our positions. When the time for counter-attack comes, we will reap an easy harvest."
 germany_radical_deluge_support_brigades: "Поддержка бригад"
 germany_radical_deluge_support_brigades_desc: "As the front-line troops are becoming more specialised and advanced, we need to make sure the rear area forces can handle their demands. Whether they are saving lives in ambulances or bringing supplies to the fighting men, they will have a large effect on battles."
 germany_radical_deluge_new_training_regimes: "Новые тренировочные режимы"
 germany_radical_deluge_new_training_regimes_desc: "Bayoneting straw dummies is a hallowed tradition, but leadership, marksmanship, physical fitness and survival programmes may be more useful in today's army. We should investigate new training regimes."
 germany_radical_deluge_specialist_roles: "Роли специалиста"
 germany_radical_deluge_specialist_roles_desc: "The varied climates and circumstances a modern army can find itself in require us to consider new forms of training and equipment. A regiment prepared for garrisoning a city will be in for a shock if it tries fighting up a mountain, or storming a fortified beach."
 germany_radical_deluge_marines: "Морпехи и морская пехота"
 germany_radical_deluge_marines_desc: "Assaults on fortified beaches and defended ports are extremely dangerous affairs. They require dedicated logistics, specialist equipment, trained soldiers and organised leaders. Amphibious assaults are a pinnacle of combined arms operations and they are not something to be left to chance."
 germany_radical_deluge_paratroopers: "Парашютные и авиационные подразделения"
 germany_radical_deluge_paratroopers_desc: "Using parachutes or gliders to rapidly deploy soldiers into battle is the logical apex of manoeuvre warfare. They could strike without warning anywhere within a hundred miles of an airbase, to secure a crossroads, harass an enemy, or assist other troops landing on a port or beach. Such an endeavour would require the dedication of a whole branch of the army."
 germany_radical_deluge_mobile_warfare: "Мобильная война"
 germany_radical_deluge_mobile_warfare_desc: "The proliferation of automobiles may have ramifications outside of civilian life. The old concept of the dragoon could be updated for the industrial age in the form of motorised infantry."
 germany_radical_deluge_armoured_warfare: "Бронированная война"
 germany_radical_deluge_armoured_warfare_desc: "The tank is a recent innovation, though already recognised as an important part of a modern army. A line of trenches and machineguns can hold back infantry, but the armour will run rings around less mobile enemies."
 germany_radical_deluge_field_exercises: "Полевые учения"
 germany_radical_deluge_field_exercises_desc: "The armed forces have changed a great deal since the end of the Great War, but though we put our best efforts into modernisation, we must ensure all the changes work in practice."
 germany_radical_deluge_aircraft_industry: "Авиационная промышленность"
 germany_radical_deluge_aircraft_industry_desc: "The flying corps of the Great War proved themselves as artillery spotters and aerial scouts, but advances have not stopped there. We need to consider air frames capable of pulverising infantry and infrastructure, new kinds of fighters and swift interceptors, even carrier-borne torpedo bombers."
 germany_radical_deluge_aircraft_developments: "Авиационные материалы"
 germany_radical_deluge_aircraft_developments_desc: "New materials allow aircraft to withstand more damage or achieve greater speeds and heights. Some countries are experimenting with all-metal airframes, others are further developing the wooden airframe concept. Fibreglass is a new invention but it also may have applications for reducing weights."
 germany_radical_deluge_army_airforce: "Автономные ВВС"
 germany_radical_deluge_army_airforce_desc: "The missions performed by our air crews will always be part of a larger goal, whether on the ground, at sea, or at the negotiating table. That said, the requirements and demands of the personnel may be better fulfilled by an independent organisation."
 germany_radical_deluge_flight_schools: "Летные школы"
 germany_radical_deluge_flight_schools_desc: "Modern aircraft have shown a great deal of promise in their technical specifications, but the pilots and navigators need to be professionals to make the most of them. The more time they spend in the air, the better they can perform their missions."
