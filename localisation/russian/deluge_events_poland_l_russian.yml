[From.GetAdjective] пропаганда провозглашает, что западные славяне должны быть объединены в одном государстве, вдали от австрийского господства. Предполагается, что армия [From.GetAdjective] полностью мобилизована, чтобы силой подать претензии."

The [From.GetAdjective] army is believed to be fully mobilised to press the claim by force."

 polish_expansion6title: "Union of Poland and Lithuania"
 polish_expansion6desc: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that the republics of Poland and Lithuania will henceforth be governed by one centralised state under the universal principles of unity and brotherhood.\n[From.GetNameDef] derives its legitimacy from the support of the masses, but it has a less radical past, as the union of the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania existed for several hundred years until its destruction by Prussia, Austria and Russia during the great conflagration that gripped the world following the French Revolution. Today's announcement thus remedies a sore point of Polish pride: that Napoleon created only a rump Polish state rather than the much larger union that again dominates Central Europe."

Today's announcement thus remedies a sore point of Polish pride: that Napoleon created only a rump Polish state rather than the much larger union that again dominates Central Europe."
 polish_expansion7opta: "For our freedom and yours!"
 polish_expansion7optb: "They are just opening up new markets for the Polish capitalists to exploit."

 polish_expansion7opte: "Democrats are weak fools, they will fall before long."
 polish_expansion8title: "Personal Union of Poland and Lithuania"
 polish_expansion8desc: "[From.GetLeader] has declared the restoration of the personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This marks the return of a state of affairs long since passed, as the union existed for several hundred years until its destruction by Prussia, Austria and Russia during the great conflagration that gripped the world following the French Revolution. Today's announcement thus remedies a sore point of Polish pride: that Napoleon created only a rump Polish state rather than the much larger union that again dominates Central Europe."
 polish_expansion8opta: "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
 polish_expansion8optb: "A ridiculous anachronism that should have stayed dead."

 deluge_poland1title: "Józef Piłsudski Passes Away"
 deluge_poland1desc: "The famous Field Marshal Józef Piłsudski has passed away at the age of 69. He led Poland through the recent Great War, and though he was unsuccessful in defeating the French on the field, he remains loved by many Poles.\n\nThe Marshal's political proteges now manoeuvre against one another to win the support of the [Root.GetRulingParty] and be recognised as his successor. Two camps have emerged: the hardliners of General Anders, and the reformers of General Sikorski. Anders has declared that Poland's defeat was due to insufficient discipline at home during the war and has demanded a political purge aimed against suspected Radical sympathisers, while Sikorski advocates lifting the state of emergency and restoring elections."
 deluge_poland1opta: "The Marshal's work is not yet done, but General Anders will complete it."
