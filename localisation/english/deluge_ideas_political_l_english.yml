 deluge_russia_incompetent_military: "Incompetent Stavka"
 deluge_russia_incompetent_military_desc: "The senior officers of Russia are drawn mostly from the nobility, with little meritocratic selection. The issue is compounded by the interference of the Tsar and his ministers, such as Grigori Rasputin. The folly of this approach was recently demonstrated in the Great War during which Stavka was utterly unable to cope with the demands of modern total war. Supply issues plague the troops and there is a culture of blame in the officer corps preventing accountability and initiative."

 deluge_jomini_idea: "Jominian Theories"
 deluge_jomini_idea_desc: "A Switzer who joined the Revolutionary armies at a young age, Jomini achieved rapid promotion under Napoleon thanks to his intelligence and diligence. He was an admirer of Frederick the Great's lightning war in Silesia and of the school of rationalism, which holds that humanity is progressing towards a scientific understanding of all endeavours. He therefore believed in scientific rules of war which good generals should obey or else face disaster.\nHis strategic ideas became a mainstay of general staffs during the Long Nineteenth Century, where limited wars between the Great Powers and their small standing armies necessitated superior mobility and maneuver. By bringing enough force to a critical spot in the enemy's lines of communication, Jomini believed victory could be achieved as a matter of course, like a chess game unfolding. Surrender would be assured and needless bloodshed avoided.\nFinding the critical spot to strike, and assuring that one's plans are not betrayed and the critical spot reinforced, means superior intelligence is essential to victory."
 deluge_clausewitz_idea: "Clausewitzian Theories"
 deluge_clausewitz_idea_desc: "A Prussian who fought Napoleon as a junior officer, Clausewitz saw the small professional armies of the Ancien Régime shattered by the mass conscript armies of a nationalistic France. This change from the limited war of dynasty against dynasty to the absolute (or 'perfect') war of people against people, where the entire population throws itself into the cause of war, informed his ideas on how war should be waged and its relationship to society - he coined the maxim that 'war is the continuation of politics by other means'. His ideas were elastic principles rather than rigid rules and the idea of friction - of things going wrong - plays a key role. For example, an offensive will gradually lose its momentum as the defender accrues more advantages from terrain, shorter supply lines and patriotic defiance, until eventually the culminating point is reached and a counter-offensive will throw back the aggressor.\nThe relative peace of the Long Nineteenth Century once seemed to indicate a reversion to limited wars, but the holocaust of the Great War appears to have vindicated Clausewitz."
 deluge_bulow_idea: "Bülowian Theories"
 deluge_bulow_idea_desc: "A Prussian whose contempt for his own state's deficiencies led to him joining the French, Bülow was lucky to have survived the Napoleonic wars, as a French defeat would likely have meant his death in gaol.\nA scion of the Enlightenment, Bülow believed that military affairs should be ordered by a central commanding intelligence, with the generals and armies implementing the commander's master plan with little autonomy. Naturally he saw Napoleon in this commanding role, and he opposed Prussian autocracy in favour of the nationalism of France which was sweeping through Europe like a flood at the time. Believing French victory to be inevitable, he was imprisoned for his defeatist publications and attitude. After being liberated by the destruction of the Prussian state, he sought to enter French service but was shunned by the senior command for his stubborness and pathological egotism. Since his theories on military strategies based purely on mathematical principles were never implemented, they remain undeveloped, but his ideas on geopolitics and infantry tactics were pioneering works. He accurately predicted the shape of post-Napoleonic Europe based on natural and national barriers."
