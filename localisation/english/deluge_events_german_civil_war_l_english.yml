 german_civil_war7desc: "The Communists are beating back the loyalist Westphalian troops. A 'People's Republic' on our very border is looking increasingly likely. At this rate, the German king will be forced to flee into exile within months. We cannot allow our good Great War ally to be abandoned in his time of need! We should invite King Frederick II to rejoin the Continental System and help destroy the rebels!\n\nOf course, dragging France into another war while our people are still shaken by the horrors of the trenches will be immensely unpopular."

 german_civil_war10title: "French Intervention in the German Civil War"
 german_civil_war10desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has been formally readmitted to the Continental System in response to their inability to deal decisively with internal rebellions. [From.GetLeader] issued a joint statement with the French Emperor to the effect that all rebels must immediately lay down arms or be crushed. The French government should begin moving troops into Germany soon, in what most observers agree will be a short campaign against the disorganised Reds and nationalists.\n\nThis marks a low point in the popular legitimacy of the Westphalian monarchy."

 german_civil_war11title: "Seek Aid From Poland?"
 german_civil_war11desc: "The spineless monarchists have sought aid from France. Unable to save themselves from our advances, they will hide behind the numberless hordes of cowardly French conscripts. While Frenchmen are mere cannon fodder compared to German troops, we only have so many bullets to spare. We could appeal to the Polish nationalists next door for assistance. They will undoubtedly see the benefits to Poland of a strong Germany."

 german_civil_war11optb: "We don't need Polish help to save Germany."
 german_civil_war12title: "Render Aid To Germany?"
 german_civil_war12desc: "The spineless German monarchists have sought aid from France. They have been utterly unable to crush the weak Red and nationalist uprisings, and now the numberless hordes of French conscripts descend upon Germany. [From.GetLeader] has communicated his desire to join the Polish bloc, and help us overthrow French dominance of Europe in a Second Great War. More likely he seeks to save his own skin from defeat, having been eclipsed in strength thanks to French intervention."
 german_civil_war12opta: "We will build a new Europe free from weak kings."

 german_civil_war13desc: "In response to the recent French intervention, [From.GetLeader] has announced formal recognition of the ultranationalist government as the sole legitimate representative of Germany, and has signed a military alliance with them.\n\nEurope is rapidly descending into a Second Great War. The Treaty of Versailles has been undone almost before the ink was dry."

 german_civil_war13optd: "Hopefully the decadent monarchists will see sense and surrender."
 german_civil_war14title: "French Neutrality"
 german_civil_war14desc: "After inconclusive debates in the National Assembly, the French Emperor has decided against intervening in the ongoing German Civil War.\n\nThe monarchist movement has seen recent defeats in the field against the rebels, but public sentiment in France is firmly against helping the old Great War ally.\n\nThis is likely to spell the death knell of the Westphalian monarchy."
 german_civil_war14opta: "Good news for President Thälmann!"

 german_civil_war15title: "Mobilising Civilian Labour"
 german_civil_war15desc: "Our lines are being pushed back by the reactionaries. The victories we won in the last few months are being undone and morale is beginning to waver. We need to demonstrate to the people and to our soldiers that [Root.GetLeader]'s government can take decisive action to defend the revolution.\n\nThe mobilisation of patriotic citizens into construction battalions will quell doubts over the commitment of the government to ultimate victory, and will prevent the reactionaries making further gains into [Root.GetNameDef]'s industrial heartland."

 german_civil_war15optb: "We won't tyrannise the German people as the reactionaries do."
 german_civil_war16title: "Communist Labour Battalions"
 german_civil_war16desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has begun conscripting civilians into construction battalions used for fortifying key locations such as bridges and major cities. In a speech to the Volkskammer, [From.GetLeader] stated that 'desperate times call for desperate measures', and called on patriotic German citizens to do their part to 'achieve ultimate victory over the reactionaries.'\n\nWhile the bunkers, minefields and trench lines arround Dortmund and Essen may only be situationally useful, the ability of the Communist state to mobilise large numbers of men will likely be more important to the war effort."
 german_civil_war16opta: "The people are the heroes now!"
 german_civil_war16optb: "A tyrannical system."
 german_civil_war16optc: "Upstart peasants."
 german_civil_war16optd: "An effective system."
 german_civil_war17title: "The German High Seas Fleet"
 german_civil_war17desc: "Although many sailors mutinied at the start of the German Civil War, most going over to the Radicals, the bulk of the Hochseeflotte was interned in the French port of Brest thanks to the quick efforts of the Monarchist officers and the assistance lent to them by the French Navy. Very few warships escaped, although many interned sailors deserted and made their way back to Germany by land.\n\nWith the end of the German Civil War, we are faced with the choice of either recognising the victorious government as the legitimate owner of the fleet, or else seizing it for ourselves. Half a dozen sturdy battleships would be quite a prize."
 german_civil_war17opta: "Return the fleet to the Westphalian king."
 german_civil_war17optb: "Let the nationalists have the fleet."
 german_civil_war17optc: "Let the Radicals have the fleet."

Very few warships escaped, although many interned sailors deserted and made their way back to Germany by land.\n\nWith our nation at war and the future still very uncertain, we must make a decision now on the fate of the German fleet. It would be unthinkable to allow half a dozen sturdy battleships to sail away when our survival may depend on keeping them."

 german_civil_war23desc: "With the end of the civil war, our administration needs to be settled in a place that suits our purposes. We have many criteria to consider - prestige, historic tradition, population and industry, and ease of defence."
 german_civil_war23opta: "Berlin is Germany's largest and most important city."
 german_civil_war23optb: "Munich is the capital of culture in Germany."

 german_civil_war24title: "Victory"
 german_civil_war24desc: "We have destroyed our enemies and restored order to Germany, but at some cost. Amidst the fighting our state's guiding ideology turned towards a new direction. The accolades we would have received from our ideological brothers around the world will not be ours, although we no longer desire the support from fools such as those."
 german_civil_war24opt: "We still won."
 german_civil_war25title: "August von Mackensen Retires"
 german_civil_war25desc: "With the chaos of the civil war behind Germany, our great Marshal has decided to spend his final years basking in the glory while letting a new generation of leaders guide Germany's destiny. Given that he was born in 1849, this rest is well earnt after a lifetime of service to the nation.\n\nThe apparent successor is currently Reinhard von Halle, the commander of the paramilitary Teutonic Knights, but the senior military staff dislike his uncompromising zealotry and would prefer a more pragmatic and secular military dictatorship. This opposition has coalesced around experienced General Staff officer Werner von Blomberg. Additionally, many Prussian aristocrats are backing a Hohenzollern restoration, but they have little support within the army."
 german_civil_war25opta: "For God and Nation, Reinhard will finish von Mackensen's great work!"
 german_civil_war25optb: "Get this hot head out of here."
 german_civil_war25optc: "This bickering is exactly why Germany needs a Hohenzollern."

 german_civil_war26desc: "With the chaos of the civil war behind Germany, August von Mackensen, Reichskanzler and Marshal, has gone into retirement. Given that he was born in 1849, this rest is well earnt.\n\nThe new leader of Germany is [From.GetLeader], commander of the paramilitary Teutonic Knights. His uncompromising zealotry caused great concern amongst the senior army officers, and Reinhard's first actions have been to suppress a military coup by veteran General Staffer Werner von Blomberg."
 german_civil_war26opta: "Yet another murderous reactionary takes centre stage."

Given that he was born in 1849, this rest is well earnt.\n\nThe new leader of Germany is [From.GetLeader], a veteran General Staff officer. The paramilitary wing of the state, the 'Teutonic Knights', have begun to lose credibility thanks to their excesses against Jews during the civil war and their leader, Reinhard von Halle, has been purged from the new government. [From.GetNameDefCap] will be a less overtly religious military dictatorship."

 german_civil_war28title: "Germany's Formal Style"
 german_civil_war28desc: "The rivals Reinhard von Halle and Werner von Blomberg attacked one another with such vigour that their open betrayals destroyed the credibility of the military dictatorship. Our new Hohenzollern monarch will restore the prestige of the German people. The precise nature of the new monarchy has yet to be announced to the world, though. Many Prussian aristocrats would prefer to keep the name of the old realm which faced Napoleon in battle at Jena and Dresden. Nationalists desire an Empire to rival that of the French. Constitutionalists and Democrats seek a compact as a Kingdom along British lines."

 german_civil_war28optb: "Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. We will not copy the French."
 german_civil_war28optc: "Prussia has a fine heritage, we will restore it."
 german_civil_war29title: "Hohenzollern Restoration"
 german_civil_war29desc: "With the chaos of the civil war behind Germany, August von Mackensen, Reichskanzler and Marshal, has gone into retirement. Given that he was born in 1849, this rest is well earnt.\n\nDuring the dispute over succession, the likely contenders - Reinhard von Halle and Werner von Blomberg - managed to backstab, humiliate and betray so many officers, politicians and businessmen that the military dictatorship lost all credibility. The Prussian aristocracy has presented Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, a descendent of the old Kings of Prussia, as a compromise candidate. [From.GetNameDefCap], recently declared by [From.GetLeader], has the support of enough German nationalists to make an attempt at a German monarchy without a French king."
 german_civil_war29opta: "A veneer of respectability for the bourgeoisie. With Thälmann gone, class antagonisms are less intense."
 german_civil_war29optb: "At least the worst excesses of the extremists may stop."

 german_civil_war30title: "Securing the Westphalian Monarchy"
 german_civil_war30desc: "Our military victories over the radicals and ultranationalists have bought us peace for a few years at least, but the factors underlying the rebellions remain. Our monarchy is seen as a French puppet, with little legitimacy derived from the German people themselves. We need to either secure a new source of power from abroad, appeal to the nationalism of the people, or negotiate a social contract as a constitutional monarchy."
 german_civil_war30opta: "We won without French help. In time, Germany will surpass the French Empire."
 german_civil_war30optb: "We will reform into a constitutional monarchy."
 german_civil_war30optc: "We remain a loyal French ally. The German and French states must draw closer together."
 german_civil_war30optd: "[Root.GetLeader] reigns as he always has. There is no need for compromise."
 german_civil_war31title: "[From.GetNameDefCap]"
 german_civil_war31desc: "[From.GetLeader] has appealed to German nationalists within his realm to support the monarchy in order to reduce reliance on France. This turn away from French domination is likely to irritate the rest of the Napoleonic dynasty to which [From.GetLeader] belongs. Given France's non-involvement in the German Civil War, however, there is little they can do to restore their influence."
 german_civil_war31opta: "Our loyal subjects will preserve stability."
 german_civil_war31optb: "You are making a grave mistake, little cousin."

 german_civil_war31optf: "He is still a degenerate."
 german_civil_war32title: "[From.GetNameDefCap]"
 german_civil_war32desc: "King Frederick II of Westphalia has brought together legislators and statesmen to a constitutional convention to draw up a bill of rights and a structure for a democratic Germany. [From.GetLeader] is leading the first German ministry in history which holds genuine power independently of the sovereign. This new constitutional monarchy has been created to help stave off future civil wars."

 german_civil_war35title: "Ernst Thälmann Is Dead!"
 german_civil_war35desc: "Late last night, while the President was en route to his private residence after a session with the Volkskammer, his entourage came under attack from masked gunmen. The sudden attack caught the security forces off guard and the assailants managed to escape after striking the President twice. An hour ago, aides at the hospital informed us that the President has succumbed to his wounds.\n\nThis blow has shocked the government, as we have lost the guiding leader of the revolution. The Volkskammer are still in talks to decide upon a successor, while the security forces are interrogating bystanders arrested at the scene of the crime to find some clue as to the identity of the perpetrators."

 german_civil_war36title: "Investigating the Assassins"
 german_civil_war36desc: "With the assassination of the President fresh in mind, the people of Germany are demanding answers. How did the security services fail to protect the most important official in the country? Who were the assassins - a reactionary group within Germany or spies of a foreign power?"
 german_civil_war36opta: "If the people had faith in the Party, they would have protected Thälmann."
 german_civil_war36optb: "They were clearly some of von Mackensen's fanatics, nothing could have stopped them."
 german_civil_war36optc: "More likely they were French or Polish agents. We may have to declare war for this."

 german_civil_war37opt: "We didn't have anything to do with it! ... Right?"
 german_civil_war38title: "The Assassins Were Anarchists!"
 german_civil_war38desc: "The [Root.Capital.GetName] section chief of the security forces has accused a local anarchist cell of carrying out the assassination of President Ernst Thälmann. He says that the culprits have already been arrested and interrogated, and several have confessed to helping organise the political murder in order to 'punish the Party for betraying the revolution'."

 german_civil_war39title: "The Anarchists Were Framed!"
 german_civil_war39desc: "The security chief responsible for arresting the [Root.Capital.GetName] anarchists has admitted to fabricating evidence and torturing suspects into confessions. One of his aides approached the national office with proof of his deception and an internal investigation followed which dismantled the case against the anarchists. The section chief has been stripped of his rank and has plead guilty to charges of subverting the course of justice."

 german_civil_war40title: "Party Conference Begins"

 german_civil_war43desc: "After days of ideological debates, canvassing by party branches and trades unions, and a lot of back-room deals, the Marxist faction has risen to prominence in Germany. Their leader, Karl Liebknecht, has promised to promote a wide-ranging programme of economic development, building a socially planned economy from the war-torn ruins of the country which lifts even the most remote and rural proletarians out of poverty.\n\nThis news has been greeted positively by Party branches across the nation, as President Liebknecht is a prominent Party official, and this cements the late President Thälmann's legacy as a national hero."
 german_civil_war43opt: "The Marxists will harness nature with their dialectic!"
 german_civil_war44title: "Jacobins Win Power Struggle"
 german_civil_war44desc: "After days of ideological debates, canvassing by party branches and trades unions, and a lot of back-room deals, the Jacobin faction has risen to prominence in Germany. Their leader, Ludwig Renn, has promised to carry the revolution into neighbouring nations and liberate the chained proletarians from their monarchical and bourgeois oppressors.\n\nThis news has been celebrated by the armed forces and security services as President Renn is a veteran General Staff officer with decades of experience in the former Westphalian army."

Their leader, Otto Wels, has promised to maintain free elections, a free and independent press, and create a balance of powers within the government to prevent the state becoming a dictatorship in the future.\n\nPresident Wels is popular within the general public as a veteran statesman from the Westphalian era who led the fight for constitutionalism before the call of revolution had even been raised."
 german_civil_war45opt: "The Social Democrats will restore truth and justice!"

 german_civil_war46desc: "After days of ideological debates, canvassing by party branches and trades unions, and a lot of back-room deals, no faction has managed to win the power struggle and present themselves as clear victors. The Party delegates to the national conference are now holding a formal vote for successor to the Presidency, but the outcome is sure to be close..."
 german_civil_war46opta: "The Anarchists will fulfil the revolution!"
 german_civil_war46optb: "The Marxists will harness nature with their dialectic!"
 german_civil_war46optc: "The Jacobins will lead Germany to victory over the reactionaries!"

 german_civil_war47title: "Power Struggle In Germany"
 german_civil_war47desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has gone through a political upheaval in the last few weeks. State media claims that the former president, Ernst Thälmann, was assassinated by unknown gunmen. There have been unsubstantiated rumours that he was murdered by agents of the state security forces for opposing a purge of the anarchists. Whether or not that is the case, factions within Germany have fought to place their candidate on the throne, and after a week of backstabbing and blackmail, the Party has decided to appoint Rudolf Rocker, an official from one of the state-sanctioned trades unions, as the new President. Critics say he is likely a puppet of other powers within Germany."
 german_civil_war47opta: "That's not what happened at all!"
 german_civil_war47optb: "More needless bloodletting from the left-wing extremists."
 german_civil_war47optc: "This is how peasants behave when they overturn the natural order."
 german_civil_war47optd: "Radicals are too weak to hold power for long."

 german_civil_war51title: "Swedish Arms Trade"
 german_civil_war51desc: "1937 has arrived and the revolutionary war drags on. We didn't expect a quick or easy victory over the reactionaries, but we have been fighting for almost two years and the basic infrastructure of our economy is breaking down under the strain. Otto Wels, leader of the Social Democrats, has offered to help broker a trade and non-aggression agreement with the Swedish state. Though a monarchy, they have a strong constitutionalist streak and a dedication to non-intervention in the wars between the Great Powers. Otto Wels is confident he can persuade the Swedish prime minister to give us limited assistance. Marxist and Anarchist officials are understandably wary of the bourgeois dictatorship, but the army has a more pragmatic view and wants Chief of Staff Ludwig Renn to accompany the delegation to buy military hardware."
 german_civil_war51opta: "Any source of support would be invaluable for the war effort."
 german_civil_war51optb: "Are you insane? They are a monarchy, a class enemy, and have claims on our territory!"
 german_civil_war52title: "Treaty with Germany"
 german_civil_war52desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent envoys to [Root.GetLeader] in order to agree to a non-aggression treaty and limited arms sales. The Westphalian king stole Hamborg and the Duchies of Slesvig-Holsten from our nation many years ago, so if we have any desire to press our claims this would be a foolish move. On the other hand, it would empower the Social Democratic faction within the German Communist Party, which might create a permanent ally in Germany."
 german_civil_war52opta: "We can spare a small quantity of hardware for the German republicans."
 german_civil_war52optb: "We can spare a small quantity of hardware for the German republicans."
 german_civil_war52optc: "Absolutely not."
 german_civil_war53title: "Sweden Accepts Treaty"
 german_civil_war53desc: "[From.GetLeader] has accepted the non-aggression pact proposed by Otto Wels, and Ludwig Renn was able to procure a single battery of 12 Swedish artillery pieces. This small victory not only removes one potential enemy from our border, it also goes some way to gaining recognition for the German republic as the legal successor state to the Westphalian monarchy."
 german_civil_war53opta: "Ludwig Renn's artillery will make a fine addition to our collection."
 german_civil_war53optb: "Otto Wels is a diplomatic genius, the credit is all his."
 german_civil_war54title: "Sweden Rejects Treaty"
 german_civil_war54desc: "[From.GetLeader] has declined our proposal of a non-aggression treaty and trade agreement. Ludwig Renn and Otto Wels returned from Sweden with mutual recriminations, while the Marxist and Anarchist officials have only one thing to say."
 german_civil_war54opta: "We told you so."
 german_civil_war54optb: "Ludwig Renn should not have joined the delegates, his militancy intimidated the Swedes."
 german_civil_war54optc: "Otto Wels likely sabotaged the talks from the start. Can he really be trusted?"
 german_civil_war55title: "Berlin Liberated"
 german_civil_war55desc: "People's militias and revolutionary soldiers have seized control of Berlin from the reactionaries. The historic capital of the Kingdom of Prussia is wealthy and well-developed, with many businesses and industries owned by Prussian aristocrats. The people are surely clamouring for redistribution!"
 german_civil_war55opta: "We can start the transition to a socially planned economy!"
 german_civil_war55optb: "Wait until things have settled - we can't afford to lose the good will of the locals."
 german_civil_war55optc: "To Hell with their good will, search them for weapons and confiscate their rifles."
 german_civil_war56title: "München Liberated"
 german_civil_war56desc: "Troops loyal to the People and Party have forced their way into the capital of the former Kingdom of Bavaria. The Westphalian monarchy preferred to reside here over their official capital at Kassel because of the many splendid castles and palaces built upon the blood and sweat of proletarians. Our fighters have captured entire museums full of paintings, busts, porcelain chinaware and other artworks."
 german_civil_war56opta: "Smash the old world! Build the new!"
 german_civil_war56optb: "Keep that maniac away from them, those are national treasures!"
 german_civil_war56optc: "Let the Swiss enjoy them, we need rifles."
