FRA_reliable_source_desc:0 "There is no reason to doubt the truthfulness of our words: France has always been in the center of world attention and now, when another big confrontation is breaking out, there are many who want to challenge our superiority.

FRA_public_opinion:0 "Public Opinion"
FRA_public_opinion_desc:0 "In order to win quickly and meet less resistance, we need to neutralize the habits of the military. Printing houses loyal to us will have to work hard when we increase the circulation of newspapers, posters and leaflets discrediting the military machine."
FRA_legalization_of_trade_unions:0 "Legalization of Trade Unions"
FRA_legalization_of_trade_unions_desc:0 "The most important step towards the Republic will be fair labor law. Now that the upper classes have wavered because of May, we can put more pressure on them.

FRA_widespread_loyalty:0 "Widespread Loyalty"
FRA_widespread_loyalty_desc:0 "An Empire cannot exist without subjects, this is its foundation.

FRA_soldiers'_solidarity_desc:0 "It became clear that the authorities cannot oppose us because of weakness or because of solidarity with us, but there is a threat worse than loyalists — these are right-wing radicals who, thanks to their ties with the army, become enemy number one.

FRA_divide_the_economy_desc:0 "France's economic model is a unique example of how the state and the military machine can work together, but in order to overcome the current situation, a more subtle approach is required — we will officially allow small businesses to take a place in the sector."
FRA_updated_safety_rules:0 "Updated Safety Rules"
FRA_updated_safety_rules_desc:0 "The current safety rules at work do not correspond to reality, as they did not provide for progress. We will also monitor employers who put pressure on workers, which is why they are forced to put themselves at risk."

FRA_equal_civil_rights:0 "Equal Civil Rights"
FRA_equal_civil_rights_desc:0 "Even if a person is a French citizen, he may have a lack of rights, for example, if it is a woman or an immigrant.

FRA_a_man_of_labor_desc:0 "To destroy the imperial order means to bring society to a new stage of development.

FRA_diktator:0 "The Dictator"
FRA_diktator_desc:0 "In order to preserve the empire for the next generations of the French, our emperor needs to limit his actions against the authorities right now.

FRA_corporatist_economics:0 "Corporatist Economics"
FRA_corporatist_economics_desc:0 "The method of licking the shoes of everyone who is ready to take a government contract is pathetic.

FRA_national_state:0 "National State"
FRA_national_state_desc:0 "French culture and lifestyle are the greatest assets of the world. All other peoples copy them clumsily, when the original does not need to depend on anyone. We will prove it to all doubters."

FRA_invasion_of_abyssinia_desc:0 "The obstacle to the reunification of our African territories is now the invasion of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia, a weak state in East Africa, trying to adopt the Western lifestyle and governance. Well, it'll be easier for them to do it when we show up."

FRA_one_france_one_monarch_desc:0 "The hour has come for Louisiana to answer for its crimes before the people.

FRA_religious_concordat:0 "Religious Concordat"
FRA_religious_concordat_desc:0 "The path we have traveled from economic collapse to a newly mighty empire partly lies on our Catholic self-consciousness.

FRA_squeeze_the_maximum:0 "Squeeze the Maximum"
FRA_squeeze_the_maximum_desc:0 "The revolution must be continued, otherwise we will be defeated again. The weak figures of our movement must be replaced by self-confident revolutionaries. It's too late to implement the old plans of the XVIII century, we need new ones, we need socialism."

FRA_reconciliation_committee_desc:0 "Those who like the idea of a republic will definitely have ideas about how it should look.

FRA_leadership_of_the_private:0 "Leadership of the Private"
FRA_leadership_of_the_private_desc:0 "Private ownership of the means of production is now only formally a form of capitalism.

FRA_from_workers_to_workers:0 "From Workers to Workers"
FRA_from_workers_to_workers_desc:0 "Another way to win over the working class to our side is the introduction of workers' self-government.

The parasitic capitalists of the past were only intermediaries in this management system, appropriating the results of labor for themselves."
FRA_business_decision:0 "Business Decision"
FRA_business_decision_desc:0 "The army is suspicious of the Jacobins. We must convince the military officials that they are not in danger if they observe the laws and regulations of new France. In return, we promise not to interfere too much in the affairs of the army and not to politicize it."

FRA_a_valuable_resource:0 "A Valuable Resource"
FRA_a_valuable_resource_desc:0 "People have always been what the state needs. Factories are useless without people.

FRA_trucks_for_the_people_desc:0 "We have the opportunity to create a powerful, inexpensive in production and adaptive transport that will appeal to our population and the armed forces.

FRA_a_car_is_a_man's_friend_desc:0 "The country's transport potential has developed, which means it's time to take up more complex specialized equipment.

FRA_factory_communities:0 "Factory Communities"
FRA_factory_communities_desc:0 "It's time for France to create factory communities instead of squalid barracks and slums.

FRA_the_blood_of_the_state_desc:0 "For the effective operation of the military force, more needs to be pumped out of the bowels. We will invest money in any company that is ready to seriously undertake to ensure the power of France."

FRA_the_cult_of_oil_desc:0 "Our lands on the continent and our overseas territories are simply replete with natural resources, including the oil we need so much, we just need to find it. Even the most nondescript desert can hide the key to industrial and military domination."
FRA_naval_strategy:0 "Naval Strategy"
FRA_naval_strategy_desc:0 "Our admirals have calculated what the government should pay attention to. In general, they want to convey to us that the improvement of the fleet should go both qualitatively and quantitatively. The talking is about expanding naval schools and optimising construction. Both are tempting, but it will take a long time."

FRA_pacify_quebec_desc:0 "Quebec is our old colony, which betrayed us, but which we no longer claim. However, history has decreed that the unfortunate Quebec has become a victim of insane Jacobins who wave their fists at all civilized countries. Dealing with this threat will be another victory of reason over stupidity."
