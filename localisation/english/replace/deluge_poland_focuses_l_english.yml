 ###POLITICAL TREE###
 
 POL_death_of_marshal:0 "Death of the Marshal"
 POL_death_of_marshal_desc:0 "Józef Klemens Piłsudski, Marshal of Poland, has passed away. Now the fate of the country is being decided — whether the old order will be continued or a new one will begin. Without a doubt, this opens the door to power for some ambitious figures, no matter how much they mourn our loss."
 
 POL_continue_with_sanation:0 "The Party of Healing"
 POL_continue_with_sanation_desc:0 "The government has no nobler task than to continue the work of our first General Inspector. There are people who are ready to inherit the great responsibility of healing society - to inherit Sanation."
 
 POL_smigly_wins:0 "Edward Rydz-Śmigły"
 POL_smigly_wins_desc:0 "Rydz-Śmigły is an ideal candidate for the role of Marshal. This is a person with experience in both the army and aviation, who is not afraid to make difficult decisions. If we want not only to protect Poland, but also to restore it to its former greatness, then we need Edward."
 POL_purge_undersirables:0 "Undesirable Elements"
 POL_purge_undersirables_desc:0 "The issue of power has been resolved, but some do not understand it or refuse to understand it. These fools need to be taught a lesson. We will grab the leaders and the most vociferous members of defeatist parties, movements and clubs for the edification of others."
 POL_enforce_patriarchy:0 "Imposition of Patriarchy"
 POL_enforce_patriarchy_desc:0 "Marshal Piłsudski gave many, even too many rights to the female population. Now we understand that it was a mistake. Women should be aware of their place in society — to keep a hearth and home, to give birth to children, to be a support to their husband. Indulging liberals will only bring discord into society."
 POL_teach_about_national_myths_in_schools:0 "The National Myths"
 POL_teach_about_national_myths_in_schools_desc:0 "The myth is not always about fiction. It can be used as motivation, a reason to work and struggle for a grand idea. Even if what we are fighting for never existed, it makes no sense to prove it now and is even dangerous. We will build a new formation and it does not matter whether it grew out of a myth or not."
 POL_national_myth_of_scythian_origin:0 "The Myth of Scythian Origin"
 POL_national_myth_of_scythian_origin_desc:0 "The Scythians are a huge group of nomadic tribes, one of which was the Sarmatians. There are theories about their Iranian and Altan origin, but for us it does not matter. The important thing is that we can trace our origin from them through many documents. Another important aspect is that once the Polish nobility claimed that they are Sarmatians."

 POL_national_myth_of_hyperborea_desc:0 "Our theorists believe that somewhere beyond the Urals, in northern Siberia, is the ancient land of Hyperborea, described by the «Father of History» Herodotus, from where many tribes originate.

 POL_begin_oczyszczenie_project:0 "The Purification Project"
 POL_begin_oczyszczenie_project_desc:0 "Our nation deserves the best fate, but there are those who interfere: the peoples who have artificially flooded our historical homeland, who have no roots here, who claim Polish land. That's enough! It's time to evict them back and liberate the territory that belongs to us by right."
 POL_start_project_in_kashubia:0 "The Project in Kashubia"
 POL_start_project_in_kashubia_desc:0 "Having regained the Kashubian lands, we faced local resistance, mainly German.

In a couple of generations..."
 POL_start_project_in_germany:0 "The Project in Germany"
 POL_start_project_in_germany_desc:0 "The heart of Prussia is in our hands! Now our government faces a difficult task to pacify these wild lands.

 POL_start_project_in_north_east:0 "The Project in the North-East"
 POL_start_project_in_north_east_desc:0 "There are many ethnic minorities living on our fringes with Livonia and Belarus. By teaching children in schools in their own languages, these small communities divide our people and distance themselves from the state. If they want to live in Poland, then they should be kind enough to speak Polish."
 POL_continue_project_in_lithuania:0 "The Project in Lithuania"
 POL_continue_project_in_lithuania_desc:0 "Lithuania is once again united with the Polish state. Unfortunately, the years of independence and the Red Terror turned Lithuanians against us. They have forgotten our common history and culture, but we will be glad to remind them."
 POL_continue_project_in_belarus:0 "The Project in Belarus"
 POL_continue_project_in_belarus_desc:0 "The Belarusian statehood is truly ridiculous. But now that historical justice has prevailed, we can return Polish identity to this region. But first we will have to get out of the way the bandits who annoy our administration."
 POL_start_project_in_south_east:0 "The Project in the South-East"
 POL_start_project_in_south_east_desc:0 "The Ukrainian people living on our territory do not associate themselves with our great state, which is extremely outrageous. It's time to act tough — we will restrict the use of the Ukrainian language in the press, the education system and cultural events."
 POL_continue_project_in_ukraine:0 "The Project in Ukraine"
 POL_continue_project_in_ukraine_desc:0 "Embittered by the whole world, Ukrainian collectivists are no longer in power. We will bring prosperity to this rich land that was once ours.

 POL_project_is_finished:0 "Finish the Project"
 POL_project_is_finished_desc:0 "Our polonization project is nearing completion. And although a lot of police and military resources have been spent, the results of the Purification will be an increase in profits, manpower and loyalty to the authorities. And now let's destroy all unnecessary evidence and reports related to the actions of Polish soldiers in our new territories..."
 POL_contact_nationalist_radicals:0 "National Radicalism"
 POL_contact_nationalist_radicals_desc:0 "The teachings of radical extremists and the state are incompatible. However, there are those in the ranks of the Reds who do not want the overthrow of our power, but its power, although they interpret it differently. We can use these misguided ones by putting pressure on their patriotic feelings."
 POL_force_atheism:0 "State Atheism"
 POL_force_atheism_desc:0 "As they say, religion is the opiate of the masses. Poles are too keen on believing in postulates that are hundreds of years old, like addicts. This does not bring any benefit to the state. We will launch a large anti-religious campaign aimed primarily at the younger generation."
 POL_nationalise_churches:0 "Nationalization of Churches"
 POL_nationalise_churches_desc:0 "If at the beginning of time religion played an educational role, then in the age of machines and electricity it is exceptionally destructive. If we deprive religion of its main food base — churches, we will stop the obscurantism that has lasted for centuries. Everyone should realize that there is no God, there is only Poland and the Marshal!"
 POL_create_ozn:0 "Camp of National Unity"
 POL_create_ozn_desc:0 "After we have cut religion out of the body of society, it is necessary to instill new values in people.

 POL_ensure_complete_political_dominance:0 "Political Purity"
 POL_ensure_complete_political_dominance_desc:0 "It was only necessary to face the issue of power, as comrades in Sanation such as Walery Sławek and Władysław Sikorski ceased to be comrades. To complete the picture of a united and ready Poland, it is necessary to eliminate the main opposition elements that do not cooperate with the Marshal."
 POL_disband_secret_societies:0 "Disband Secret Societies"
 POL_disband_secret_societies_desc:0 "Masons and other secret Jewish groups pose a great danger to our country — many of them infiltrated the previous government and now they want to get this one! They should be banned, and the most influential arrested."
 POL_massive_propaganda_efforts:0 "The Ultimate Truth"
 POL_massive_propaganda_efforts_desc:0 "Just posters and newspapers are not enough, we need to completely rebuild the information space.

The voice of truth must be heard from everywhere."
 POL_teach_about_etatism:0 "Etatism"
 POL_teach_about_etatism_desc:0 "It is unthinkable that foreign companies should take a share in the Polish economy, otherwise it is not our economy at all. It is necessary to develop national capital that can compete with the rest of the world. But since it will take years to cultivate the new bourgeoisie, it is possible to achieve quick results by appropriating the property of others."
 POL_create_sm_ozn:0 "Youth Duty"
 POL_create_sm_ozn_desc:0 "Youth Duty is a youth organization of the CNU. It tells its wards about traditional family and patriotic values, as well as the importance of the army and the Marshal himself. It also prepares them to serve their fatherland — boys to become warriors, and girls to become mothers."
 POL_create_opw_ozn:0 "Camp of Fighting Poland"
 POL_create_opw_ozn_desc:0 "If the enemy sets foot on our land, both old and young will fight for their native land until our glorious army expels the foe back home. A paramilitary and covert organization will help us in this, which will train the civilian population for combat operations and support agent networks in the occupied territories."
 POL_abolish_monarchy:0 "Abolish Monarchy"
 POL_abolish_monarchy_desc:0 "The monarchy as a form of government is clumsy and ineffective, it is obvious why it does not suit our young state.

 POL_cult_of_new_marshal:0 "Marshal's Party"
 POL_cult_of_new_marshal_desc:0 "It should be clear to everyone that the old Sanation has been reborn in our wise marshal.

From now on and forever: Poland is Sanation, Sanation is the Marshal!"
 POL_use_futurists:0 "Futurism"
 POL_use_futurists_desc:0 "The futurism movement has become widespread in Poland. These people find themselves striving to reflect in their works the acceleration of the pace of life and the industrialization of the milieu as signs of a new era. Based on this, we can conclude that we are not so different, let's find a common language with them."
 POL_nuz_w_bzuhu_smigly:0 "Nuż w Bżuhu"
 POL_nuz_w_bzuhu_smigly_desc:0 "Nuż w bżuhu is a magazine in which many futurist creators publish their... art. No matter how we treat them, their unusual vision of the world largely coincides with ours, so we could use their information resource for our own purposes."
 POL_purge_futurists:0 "Traditional Art"
 POL_purge_futurists_desc:0 "All these avant-gardists are unhealthy people! Not only is it impossible to understand their work, but, most importantly, they are pushing against the traditional way of our society, which goes against our policy. It is necessary to purify art from the harmful influence of futurism and other similar trends."
 POL_concessions_to_christians:0 "Concessions to Christians"
 POL_concessions_to_christians_desc:0 "Perhaps we overreacted with the church reform. After all, Christianity is a conservative religion that can help keep society from falling into anarchy, and that's exactly what we need right now. So why not make some concessions?"
 
 POL_cult_of_old_marshal:0 "Cult of the First Marshal"
 POL_cult_of_old_marshal_desc:0 "Our people will never forget the First Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the great military commander and regent of the Polish state.

 POL_mobilize_the_masses:0 "Mobilize the Masses"
 POL_mobilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The advantage of mobilization is that every person will be involved in the mechanism of the state, and our economy will find a clear goal and will not become a victim of any crisis.

 POL_state_that_gives:0 "The Welfare State"

 POL_crush_decadency:0 "Crush Decadence"
 POL_crush_decadency_desc:0 "We have already inspired people enough to work for the common good, but there is something that hinders — this is a nationwide mood of decline.

 POL_fund_galleries_of_patriotic_art:0 "Patriotic Art Galleries"
 POL_fund_galleries_of_patriotic_art_desc:0 "It is possible to awaken mass consciousness with a new direction in art. A series of patriotic posters and the sponsorship of our artists will spur public sentiment. These works should inspire pride to us, and trembling to the enemies."
 
 POL_sikorski_wins:0 "Władysław Sikorski"
 POL_sikorski_wins_desc:0 "Although Sikorsky did not always agree with our beloved Marshal, he has zeal, and most importantly talent. He is a diligent officer and a true patriot. Who, if not him, will be able to protect our Poland from the tornado of uncertainty that is now dragging the world?"
 POL_culture_not_race:0 "Culture, not Race"
 POL_culture_not_race_desc:0 "Poland is a multinational state. If we divide its citizens by race, we will not only deprive ourselves of human resources, but also sow distemper. Instead of simply expunging small nations from our lives, we will propose to the government a plan for their acculturation."
 POL_start_cultural_integration:0 "Cultural Integration"
 POL_start_cultural_integration_desc:0 "Replacing the culture of small nations with our culture is cruel, but if we want to preserve and strengthen the unity of the people, this act is justified. It is important that future generations will not regret this and they will accept reality as it will be."
 POL_partly_free_elections:0 "Limited Elections"
 POL_partly_free_elections_desc:0 "An unambiguous dictatorship is not the most prudent idea.

 POL_promote_political_activness:0 "Political Life of Society"
 POL_promote_political_activness_desc:0 "Some believe that the participation of the people in politics is a dangerous thing.

 POL_freedom_of_religion:0 "Freedom of Religion"
 POL_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "In fact, our country rarely had problems with believers. This is what distinguishes us from other powers whose unity is based on religion, when we are united by the spirit of the people.

 POL_equality_of_man_and_woman:0 "Equality of Man and Woman"
 POL_equality_of_man_and_woman_desc:0 "Not only men are capable of performing great feats. History knows a lot about women whose deeds surpassed men's fame.

 POL_allow_and_encourage_woman_in_military:0 "Women in the Military"
 POL_allow_and_encourage_woman_in_military_desc:0 "Polish women are free to work for the good of our country, but they cannot perform military service because of entrenched stereotypes and arrogant male power. To turn a blind eye to this means to deprive ourselves of new soldiers and officers, and we are not in a position to allow ourselves such a luxury."
 POL_establish_honor_i_ojczyzna:0 "Honour and Fatherland"
 POL_establish_honor_i_ojczyzna_desc:0 "Our officers, including generals and marshals, remain scattered and true to their personal beliefs. The organization Honour and Fatherland will be able to consolidate all military aspirations and interrupt disagreements in the ranks of the armed forces."
 POL_invite_ND_to_government:0 "Invite Endecja"
 POL_invite_ND_to_government_desc:0 "National Democracy or Endecja is a right-wing nationalist party, whose slogans largely coincide with the vision of our Marshal. They are democratic enough to create the appearance of a fair system and not radical enough to put a spoke in the wheel."
 POL_emphasize_catholic_values:0 "Catholic Values"
 POL_emphasize_catholic_values_desc:0 "We tolerate any religion, but the majority of the population in our country are Catholics, and the government itself is pro-Catholic, so it would be logical to support the dominant role of Catholicism, which has accompanied Poland for many centuries."
 POL_encourage_priests_in_military:0 "Priests in the Military"
 POL_encourage_priests_in_military_desc:0 "The system of military chaplains of the Polish Military is currently in a deplorable state since the Great War because of the indifferent attitude of the Piłsudski system to it. Both the Endecja and the Catholic Church demand reform, and the positive thing is that the latter are ready to take on most of the costs we need to implement it."
 POL_religion_in_schools:0 "Religion in Schools"
 POL_religion_in_schools_desc:0 "Religious teaching has always been an unofficial part of our education system. Since the public school system is in a very deplorable state, the Catholic Church plays a significant role in its maintenance. Our allies from Endecja can help, but in return they ask for an official role for the church in the education system."
 POL_catholic_school_reform:0 "Catholic Education"
 POL_catholic_school_reform_desc:0 "After the last education reform, it became quite obvious that the Catholic Church has more influence than we thought. Now the church wants us to reform the current national curriculum and make Catholic education a mandatory part of the system."
 POL_invite_PSL_to_government:0 "Invite the PPP"
 POL_invite_PSL_to_government_desc:0 "The Polish People's Party is a merger of small agrarian parties, which advocates strengthening the positions of the peasantry in politics. By sharing government positions with them, we could use their resources to solve pressing problems."

 POL_increase_agrarian_founds_desc:0 "Objectively, the state of our rural areas is not at the level of Western European countries.

 POL_better_living_conditions_for_countryside:0 "New Rural Standards"
 POL_better_living_conditions_for_countryside_desc:0 "The biggest problem of rural areas is relatively low living conditions.

 POL_make_deal_with_king:0 "Deal with the King"
 POL_make_deal_with_king_desc:0 "Fryderyk Krystian II is not an obstacle to the Sanation government. We can use the young king for our purposes by handing him only nominal power. We will play monarchy as long as people like it."
 
 POL_stachniuk_wins:0 "Jan Stachniuk"
 POL_stachniuk_wins_desc:0 "«Stoigniew» Stachniuk is a neo-pagan with charm, influence and unusual ideas. He criticizes Christianity and capitalism, and also calls for a return to life in the traditions of the proto-Slavic society.

 POL_find_support_among_radicals:0 "Radical Support"
 POL_find_support_among_radicals_desc:0 "Some radicals consider our actions to be correct because of the economic program and attitude towards the Catholic Church. We could attract these Reds to work for the new Polish state, and not for a destructive revolution."

 POL_find_support_among_artists_desc:0 "There are artists who support our cause, but now they remain unnoticed. But as soon as they find the recognition of the government, they will be able to compete with the current artists."
 
 POL_piasecki_wins:0 "Bolesław Piasecki"
 POL_piasecki_wins_desc:0 "Piasecki is a right-wing radical ideologue who advocates building a Catholic dictatorship in Poland. There is already an autocratic order in our country, and religion plays an important role in the life of society, therefore this idea does not seem so radical..."
 POL_seek_support_from_ND:0 "Endecjan Support"
 POL_seek_support_from_ND_desc:0 "Many members of the National Democracy share our views on the future of Poland.

 POL_keep_friends_from_above_baltic_desc:0 "In the ancient times of the migration of peoples, the Balts and Slavs were one group. Later, when they moved from nomadism to a sedentary lifestyle in Eastern Europe, they split up. Our government should focus on restoring its former unity."

 POL_ONR_takes_over_desc:0 "The indecisive actions of Sanation led to the weakening of the Polish state and attacks on the church, but now that our internal enemies have disappeared, the National Radical Camp Falanga can take full power into its own hands and announce the transformation of the existing system."
 POL_falanga_and_monarch:0 "We and the Monarch"
 POL_falanga_and_monarch_desc:0 "The current monarch does not support our administration. It is understandable: how else can a king whose homeland is not Poland relate to a truly Polish government? To confirm our legitimacy, we must correct this misunderstanding."
 POL_the_third_way:0 "The Third Way"
 POL_the_third_way_desc:0 "It is obvious that the capitalist system cannot withstand the pressure of time and collapses, however, the socialists with their radical ideology would rather drive the world into the grave than fix it. Survival is guaranteed only by balance."
 POL_national_syndicalism:0 "National Syndicalism"
 POL_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "The unification of nationalism and syndicalism created the philosophy of resolving the conflict between capitalism and socialism by creating a new system of economic organization based on self-governing corporations or syndicates. We are lucky that all the prerequisites for the implementation of this system have already been created in Poland."
 POL_militarize_workers_unions:0 "Militarize Trade Unions"
 POL_militarize_workers_unions_desc:0 "The position of trade unions should be such that, receiving various bonuses from the state, they should be ready to send their people to military service at any time. We will empower them to act as a reserve force for the army."
 POL_delegalise_strikes:0 "Delegalise Strikes"
 POL_delegalise_strikes_desc:0 "In times of crisis, the government considers all forms of protest, including strikes, undoubtedly organized by enemy agents, as obstacles to maintaining stability. It's time to outlaw this and bring our workers back to their place. Patriots are not on strike!"
 POL_falangist_corporatism:0 "Falangist Corporatism"
 POL_falangist_corporatism_desc:0 "In our country, any job is important, regardless of whether it is physical or mental. Working as one big family, trusting each other, we will build a solid system with a powerful economy. But, of course, there must be those who will monitor compliance with the requirements of the government and control the process."
 POL_invest_in_middle_class:0 "Investing in the Middle Class"
 POL_invest_in_middle_class_desc:0 "Raising the standard of living of the middle class — the foundation of our society — by investing in education, public services and infrastructure will help maintain public order and emphasize the authority of the current government."
 POL_expand_war_industry:0 "Expand the War Industry"
 POL_expand_war_industry_desc:0 "The NRC insists on expanding the military industry, paying special attention to modernization. New production lines, factories and infrastructure will not only create new jobs and stimulate investment, but also provide Poland with the military equipment necessary to confront old and new threats."
 POL_autarky:0 "Autarky"
 POL_autarky_desc:0 "We have reached an acceptable level of self-sufficiency. From now on, Poland does not need foreign trade and foreign influence to function properly. Of course, we will feel the blow, because independence must have its price, but our economy will rise like a phoenix and pay back in full."
 POL_promote_national_radical_ideology:0 "National-Radical Ideology"
 POL_promote_national_radical_ideology_desc:0 "Ultranationalist ideology has never had a clear definition, only a general concept. We will thoroughly approach this issue and create an ideology with an emphasis on traditional values, self-reliance and military might."
 POL_deals_with_church:0 "Unity with the Church"
 POL_deals_with_church_desc:0 "The church is the main ally of our party and it is our duty to protect the Catholic faith on which the nation was built. We must link the government and the church together, as it once was. From now on there will be no dominant confession, only the state one!"
 POL_catholic_youth_organisations:0 "Grey Ranks"
 POL_catholic_youth_organisations_desc:0 "If we want to leave behind a future, we need to create a foundation for it. The Polish Scouting and Guiding Association — our national Scout organization — needs to be given more resources and given a new goal. Polish pioneers need to be instilled with feelings of camaraderie, courage, self-sacrifice and faith."
 POL_unite_with_onr_abc:0 "There is Only One Camp"
 POL_unite_with_onr_abc_desc:0 "After the May 1930 coup, many members of the NRC joined Piłsudski, and then created the Falanga — what we are now, while others created their own wing of the party — the NRC-ABC, and later switched to the National Democrats altogether. Now that we are in charge, it's time to stop this endless schism and accept the repentant comrades back."
 POL_establish_universal_educational_organization:0 "Universal Educational Organization"
 POL_establish_universal_educational_organization_desc:0 "The UEO is an organization that, together with parents, teachers and clergy, will create a new type of man from the teenage generation, whose credo will be the Catholic faith and national ideals."
 POL_introduce_eugenics_into_hospitals:0 "Eugenics"
 POL_introduce_eugenics_into_hospitals_desc:0 "In the last decade, the young science of breeding applicable to humans, eugenics, has been gaining popularity. And, although it was invented in the West, it is very suitable for the policy that we are pursuing. Polish scientists are able to develop this teaching, designed to combat the phenomena of degeneration in the human gene pool."
 POL_create_new_type_of_man:0 "A New Type of Man"
 POL_create_new_type_of_man_desc:0 "To show what an exemplary Pole should be, we will create a propaganda image of a new man! If it is a male, then he should be stately, fit, work hard or serve; if it is a female, then she should take care of children, be a housewife and pretty."
 POL_isolate_worse_ones_from_poles:0 "Social Control"
 POL_isolate_worse_ones_from_poles_desc:0 "We simply cannot allow anyone unworthy, like Zionists, liberals and atheists, to interfere in the lives of decent citizens. We need to isolate these antisocial elements by giving them the hardest and dirtiest work and settling them in remote places."
 POL_nationalise_minorites_fortunes:0 "Ours and Always has Been"
 POL_nationalise_minorites_fortunes_desc:0 "Various national minorities have been parasitizing Poles for centuries, especially in times of our weakness. They exploited us as moneylenders, merchants and in many other areas related to money. But now the time has come for Poland when we can return everything acquired by legitimate labor..."
 POL_clean_the_ghettos:0 "Clean the Ghettos"
 POL_clean_the_ghettos_desc:0 "In a number of cities, there are neighborhoods or entire districts of disadvantaged residents. These are mainly criminal, near-criminal and unreliable ethnic groups. The existence of such ghettos frightens people and repels business, they need to be eliminated. To do this, the government will additionally finance the penitentiary system."

 POL_transform_into_political_organization_of_the_nation_desc:0 "The Falanga has reached the peak of its development and is turning from a party into a real system that will affect all aspects of life. The new organization will have a strict hierarchy, and in order to hold an important administrative, managerial or military post, mandatory party membership will be required. We are rebuilding existence itself for the benefit of the people."
 
 POL_return_of_crusades:0 "Return to the Crusades"
 POL_return_of_crusades_desc:0 "We have defended Catholicism at home, but Poland is surrounded by a whole Christian civilization that is suffering under the yoke of autocrats. Worst of all, the places where our faith came from are now being desecrated by apostates and heretics. We can't just watch this anymore, it's time to take up arms!"
 POL_catholic_universalism:0 "Universalism"
 POL_catholic_universalism_desc:0 "If you believe in Christ, pray and repent to Him, then all earthly sins will be forgiven you. We will bring this truth to every godless and erring person in order to grant forgiveness. Others who dare to challenge us will face eternal damnation and oblivion."
 POL_retake_palestine:0 "Retake the Holy Land"
 POL_retake_palestine_desc:0 "In 1364, King Peter I of Cyprus asked King Casimir III of Poland to organize a crusade. This proposal was rejected due to domestic problems. However, now it frees our hands, because we can use these facts for legitimate claims to the Holy Land."

 POL_loyalty_to_the_vatican:0 "Loyalty to the Vatican"
 POL_loyalty_to_the_vatican_desc:0 "The confirmation of loyalty to the Vatican guarantees that the papal influence on the Polish government and society will not weaken and will provide us with spiritual support. Under the guidance of the Holy See, we will lead Poland to become a bastion of Catholic faith and morality throughout Europe. But to do this, we need to share our conquests..."
 POL_our_own_church:0 "Polish National Catholic Church"
 POL_our_own_church_desc:0 "Poles should prevail in the Catholic hierarchy of Poland, as well as services should be conducted in Polish. Back in 1551, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski spoke about this in his work «On the Improvement of the State», where he advocated the creation of a Polish church. This will inevitably lead to a schism and place great responsibility on us."
 POL_vatican_support:0 "Support from the Papal See"
 POL_vatican_support_desc:0 "We have given Palestine to the See, and now we plan to receive the full support of the Catholic Church.

 POL_popes_visist:0 "The Pope's Visit"
 POL_popes_visist_desc:0 "The Pope's visit and his visit to our historical and holy places will be an amazing event. We will not only charge our people with faith in our cause, but also show all countries of the world that the truth and the will of God are on our side."
 POL_export_catholicism_abroad:0 "Catholicism for Export"
 POL_export_catholicism_abroad_desc:0 "We can condemn heretics and sinners as much as we like, but are they worthy of such a life? These people have never seen the light, and therefore lead their way of life typical of darkness. Poland must definitely come to their aid and put an end to this nightmare."
 POL_destroy_fake_pope:0 "The End of Vatican Power"
 POL_destroy_fake_pope_desc:0 "The Vatican can make anyone who does not adhere to the general line an outcast, it decides which church is right and which is not. Since we were a worthy competitor to it, the need for a tiny enclave inside Rome disappeared. We will send the Italians a request to disband this small state."
 POL_our_own_pope:0 "Election of a New Pope"
 POL_our_own_pope_desc:0 "Now nothing prevents us from assembling our own conclave to elect a Pope. This will be a blow to the adherents of the old Roman denomination and a new page in the history of Poland, in which it becomes the mainstay of all true Catholics."
 
 POL_oppose_sanation:0 "Oppose Sanation"
 POL_oppose_sanation_desc:0 "Piłsudski's militaristic regime is nothing without him. Already, a struggle for the right to be a dictator is raging among his supporters. Let's not wait for the military to arrange terror!"
 
 POL_democracy_prevails:0 "Triumph of Democracy"
 POL_democracy_prevails_desc:0 "Having gathered the remnants of scattered democratic forces, we are able to express a vote of no confidence in the military government. The coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberal Socialists does not look like something monolithic, but if we do not present a united front now, then the Polish democracy risks forever remaining only a dream."
 
 POL_ND_wins:0 "National Democracy"
 POL_ND_wins_desc:0 "Sanation caused us enormous damage — it lured many of our supporters and comrades to its side, knocking the Endecja out of the political arena for a long time. However, now that we have recovered and taken power from them, it is time to elect our leader for Poland and lead it into a free future."
 POL_attract_foreign_investments:0 "Attract Foreign Capital"
 POL_attract_foreign_investments_desc:0 "The previous government was not too interested in the topic of investments in our state by external companies. They considered it the enslavement of Poland by foreigners, when we see this as an opportunity for enrichment and development. In this way we will open our market to others and increase the cost of labor in the country."
 POL_reforms_towards_free_market:0 "Polish Free Market"
 POL_reforms_towards_free_market_desc:0 "Polish legislation contains many old rights of the Sanation period, which were based on statist values. They prevent individuals and organizations from creating and maintaining businesses. We must reform Polish legislation in favor of the free market."
 POL_embrace_free_competition:0 "Perfect Competition"
 POL_embrace_free_competition_desc:0 "Progress is born out of competition, and free people are born out of free competition! If earlier the state indicated who to give money to and who to leave in the shadows, now everyone will be able to find a worthy competitor and do business without outside influence."

 POL_catholic_students_movement_desc:0 "It is very nice that many young minds in our country call themselves believers. The new generation would like to get rid of anti-religious sentiments both in their educational institutions and outside them. We can give them a helping hand and create a Catholic student organization."
 POL_formalize_youth_organisations:0 "Formalization of Youth Organizations"
 POL_formalize_youth_organisations_desc:0 "There are many youth organizations and movements close to us ideologically, but whose activities are still semi-official or not recognized at all. We will provide them with legal and financial support to make them part of our policy."
 POL_fight_jewish_influence:0 "Grains and Tares"
 POL_fight_jewish_influence_desc:0 "We are not building a country for everyone, but for those who deserve it. A bunch of crooks who demand equal treatment and equal rights do not understand what the Polish nation is and why it exists. We don't need feminism, radicalism, minorities and other artificial tendencies invented in the West to decompose our state."
 POL_take_away_womens_voting_rights:0 "Only Men Vote"
 POL_take_away_womens_voting_rights_desc:0 "Politics is not a thing of a woman's mind, and therefore it is stupid to give women such a thing as suffrage. It is necessary to limit the participation of the weaker sex in this area and leave it only reproductive, educational and auxiliary activities."
 POL_send_support_to_catholic_church:0 "Church and State"
 POL_send_support_to_catholic_church_desc:0 "We pulled the Catholic Church out of the disgrace of the old government and helped it to recover. In order to mutually strengthen the influence on public life, we will give the church more freedom of action in relation to the state, in return for which we expect the support of our course by its leading representatives."
 POL_come_back_to_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
 POL_come_back_to_traditional_values_desc:0 "Women's emancipation, manifestations of social extremism, the fascination of young people with foreign culture — all this suggests that our nation is moving towards degeneration. We need to turn to traditional values, when a man was the head of the family, a woman was primarily a mother, and children followed in the footsteps of their parents."
 POL_only_catholic_politicians_allowed:0 "Catholic Democracy"
 POL_only_catholic_politicians_allowed_desc:0 "To ensure the future of the nation, we need to protect its democracy from figures who seek to destroy traditions and everything that is dear to us. True defenders of the state and patriots can be considered professing Catholicism, which means only such people should be in the highest echelons of power."
 
 POL_question_of_monarchy_in_republic:0 "Deal with the Monarchy"
 POL_question_of_monarchy_in_republic_desc:0 "Historically, it turned out that for Poland, the republic is not the abolition of the monarchy. Since the Piasts died out, the country was called a republic because of the enormous influence of the nobility in our country, sometimes even more than the king himself had. Our times and mores require a revision of the monarchy system."
 POL_seek_support_among_peasants:0 "Get the Support of the Peasants"
 POL_seek_support_among_peasants_desc:0 "During the cancellation of Sanation, we encountered its adherents in the army and administration. But in order to reach them, first we need to get public support, and we will start with the most suffering, but broad class — the peasantry. We will allocate funds for a major social program for rural and remote regions."
 POL_fight_corruption_in_army:0 "Purity in the Army"
 POL_fight_corruption_in_army_desc:0 "Our army is ruled not by the General Staff, but by corruption, nepotism and the ghost of Piłsudski. We need to take serious steps to stop the rotting of our armed forces. We will involve the special services and the military prosecutor's office to identify the root of the problem."
 POL_fight_corruption_in_administration:0 "Purity in the Administration"
 POL_fight_corruption_in_administration_desc:0 "The Sanation government has almost completely subdued the civil administration and turned it into its playground. To burn out corruption, it is necessary to make the very thought of it cause awe before our justice."
 POL_help_middle_class:0 "Expand the Middle Class"
 POL_help_middle_class_desc:0 "The middle class is the core of society, but in our country it exists only as a thin layer between wealthy people and poor people, which is why it is difficult for us to stabilize the economic situation. To achieve this, we will introduce luxury taxes for some and social benefits for others."
 POL_privatization_of_schools:0 "Privatization of Education"
 POL_privatization_of_schools_desc:0 "To increase the level of teaching in our educational institutions, we can privatize most of them. This, of course, will reduce control over what modern youth are learning, but it will also reduce the costs of the entire system and allow them to direct finances in a more relevant direction."
 POL_privatization_of_healthcare:0 "Privatization of Healthcare"
 POL_privatization_of_healthcare_desc:0 "Our hospitals and clinics are insufficiently equipped and suffer from a shortage of staff, but we still pay a lot for them. Commerce will do a better job of improving the quality of medical care and stimulating workers when we find a better use for the state budget."
 POL_improve_states_schools:0 "Public Education"
 POL_improve_states_schools_desc:0 "In order to reduce the illiteracy rate in Poland, we need to spend more on the education system. It is necessary to reform the basic curriculum, build more schools, repair old ones, get teachers interested in working, buy modern educational equipment and import teaching methods from the West."
 POL_improve_states_healthcare:0 "Public Healthcare"
 POL_improve_states_healthcare_desc:0 "There is a crisis in the healthcare system: there are not enough doctors, and the main hospitals are overcrowded. We urgently need to intervene and approve a plan to increase the number of small clinics at the same time as increasing the average salary of doctors. It will probably empty our coffers, but is there any other way out?"
 POL_new_quality_of_life:0 "New Quality of Life"
 POL_new_quality_of_life_desc:0 "Now we understand how much Sanation limited the capabilities of our people. It is getting harder and harder to recognize Poland: businesses, stores, shops are opening everywhere, and all thanks to free economic relations. From this moment on, the nation is experiencing a real boom, and we hope it will never end."
 
 POL_PSL_wins:0 "Polish People's Party"
 POL_PSL_wins_desc:0 "We managed to displace the military, who occupied the government and sat in it since 1930, but it's too early to rejoice. We have yet to implement the party's program in a country plagued by dictatorship and a trade curtain. Of course, first we need to hold free and secret elections for the head of our renewed state."
 POL_birth_of_new_republic:0 "The Third Rzeczpospolita"
 POL_birth_of_new_republic_desc:0 "It's time to throw off the yoke of the kingdom imposed on us and proclaim the Third Republic! Yes, our republic is not like all the others, but this is our uniqueness — we are not chasing European revolutions, but making Polish statehood what it should be, but which was taken away from us by Sanation."
 POL_guarantee_freedom_of_religion:0 "Guarantee Freedom of Religion"
 POL_guarantee_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "All other parties want either to impose a certain religion on the people, or to restrict religion altogether. We believe that it is not necessary to interfere in the religion of our citizens — this is their personal business, only if their beliefs do not contradict the law, of course. It is worth fixing this in the constitution, as befits any democratic state."
 POL_protect_the_jews:0 "Protection of Minorities"
 POL_protect_the_jews_desc:0 "The rightist think that people who speak a different language, have a different skin color or adhere to other traditions pose a threat to society. What an absurdity! Our duty is to protect those who feel oppressed, we will show them that Poland and its government are not the enemy, which should spur them to cooperate."
 POL_improve_living_standard_in_countryside:0 "Rural Renewal"
 POL_improve_living_standard_in_countryside_desc:0 "Many peasants are very conservative and adhere to traditional views on life. We have to show that the people who really care about the people are in our party. It's time to implement everything we have planned to improve the life of the peasantry and give it everything that has been missing for decades!"
 POL_alliance_with_SCh:0 "Peasant Alliance"
 POL_alliance_with_SCh_desc:0 "Not only does the PPP put the interests of rural residents above all else, there is also a Peasant Party whose members agitate for agrarian socialism. We will not be afraid of the fact that they associate with radicals if we include them in our composition. Thus, a unified and strong agrarian party will be created."
 POL_deluge_agrarian_reform:0 "Bourgeois Land Reform"
 POL_deluge_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "Our reform should enable farmers and firms not only to distribute land fairly and fairly among themselves, but also to create such economic relations that the countryside has never known. We will allow our peasants to become entrepreneurs and earn as much as they really deserve."
 POL_help_the_poor:0 "New Workplaces"
 POL_help_the_poor_desc:0 "Unemployment is on the agenda: many people want to work, but more often it turns out that their places are already occupied. This mainly applies to cities where locals and newcomers compete for work. By investing in the countryside, we will lure some of the newcomers back and reduce the burden on the cities."
 POL_tax_the_rich:0 "Slow Down the Export of Capital"
 POL_tax_the_rich_desc:0 "Polish workers create goods, and capitalists prefer to sell these goods on the foreign market, which devalues their value for us, because it turns out that the worker worked for free. This practice will backfire in a weakening of the national currency and dependence on foreign partners, if measures are not taken now."
 POL_increase_social_benefits:0 "Social Benefits"
 POL_increase_social_benefits_desc:0 "Young people in our country are not confident in the future because of their modest financial situation, from which they do not plan to have children. This may affect the demographic situation, so we will adopt a long-term package of social assistance for the poor and young families."
 POL_equality_for_all_races_and_nations:0 "Equality for All Peoples"
 POL_equality_for_all_races_and_nations_desc:0 "Sanation exalted pure-blooded Poles and muddied all others. Let it be known to all fans of Social Darwinism that there are no «pure» races, and sometimes blood relatives meet where they could not even be. We need to fight prejudice and legislatively establish the legal status of all the peoples of Poland."
 POL_full_equality_for_women:0 "Free Polish Woman"
 POL_full_equality_for_women_desc:0 "When nationalists want to give women into kitchen slavery or throw them into the furnace of war, we will liberate the modern woman and give her the rights that everyone must have regardless of gender. Everyone will be allowed to work and serve where they see their vocation, without limiting themselves to the customs of the last century."
 POL_restrict_foreign_companies:0 "Manufacturing Competition"
 POL_restrict_foreign_companies_desc:0 "In order to increase prestige against the background of foreign companies that have found their niche in our markets, we will provide the domestic industry with unique conditions and ease financial pressure. Our firms are obliged to catch up with the productivity of investors' firms and reach the same level with them."
 POL_controlled_capitalism:0 "Controlled Capitalism"
 POL_controlled_capitalism_desc:0 "While we were radically changing the state of things, market relations in the country were growing at an unprecedented pace for us. Uncontrolled development of capitalism can lead to its seizure of important sectors of the economy that we cannot lose. It's time to tighten the nuts a little and stop this insane growth."
 
 POL_radicals_takeover:0 "Radical Coup"
 POL_radicals_takeover_desc:0 "We need to act quickly before Sanation comes to its senses. All our combat cells need to react immediately and take control or sabotage the communications and transport apparatus in the main cities of the country. We will squeeze into the resulting power vacuum and declare a radical republic!"
 POL_the_new_system:0 "The New System"
 POL_the_new_system_desc:0 "The people of Poland are already tired of the royal power, it's time to abolish the monarchical order — a symbol of coercion and oppression. We will build a new system radically different from this one economically, politically and ideologically. A vote will be held across the country for the party that best suits the interests of workers."
 POL_PPS_wins:0 "Populism of the PSP"
 POL_PPS_wins_desc:0 "The Polish Socialist Party is one of the oldest and most experienced parties. We were in the vanguard with those who fought for liberation from French rule. Now we face a new task — to bring liberation to ordinary people who are forced to exist, and not to live in the country for which we all stood together."
 POL_KPP_wins:0 "Revolution of the CPP"
 POL_KPP_wins_desc:0 "The position of the Communist Party of Poland is not popular even among radicals, mostly because of our neighbors in the east. Society is accustomed to hate the power of the councils and the revolution, but this hatred is based on empty fear and information blockade. We will show what the dictatorship of the proletariat can give to the ordinary worker."
 POL_PKWN_wins:0 "Moderation of the PCNL"
 POL_PKWN_wins_desc:0 "We created the Polish Committee of National Liberation not to bicker and create discord, but in order to attract and interest the masses. Many people are apolitical or non-partisan, but they all understand that trouble is happening to our motherland, and they are ready to stand up for a good cause and even sacrifice their lives to save it."
 POL_NSP_wins:0 "Conservatism of the NPL"
 POL_NSP_wins_desc:0 "There is no need to rush to rebuild all reactionary institutions like a daredevil. We in the National Party of Labor believe that social equality can be achieved only by taking a measured approach to the change of economic and social formation. This also applies to those who want to roll back our revolution under the pretext of a lack of action on our part."
 POL_NSPR_wins:0 "Nationalism of the NSWP"
 POL_NSPR_wins_desc:0 "The National Socialist Workers' Party will not advocate for a Worldwide Conflagration until the life and work of our compatriot is improved. We must work primarily for the benefit of the Polish people, and not waste our resources on helping everyone at once. After all, if we want to save humanity, we need to start with ourselves!"
 
 POL_cult_of_progress:0 "The Cult of Progress"
 POL_cult_of_progress_desc:0 "Capitalism once served progress, but nowadays the thirst for profit makes it irrelevant. It is easier for bourgeois to sell low-quality goods to be bought more often than to spend money on working on it. This forces science and technology to stand still only occasionally breaking forward. With us, everything that is done for the good of man is sacred."
 POL_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
 POL_socialist_education_desc:0 "Our education system should not be reformed, but redone. From the earliest years, people are pumped up with blind patriotism and faith in the chosen nation. Our system should show what a state is, why it is needed, who lives in it, and most importantly, to whom it belongs."
 POL_remember_the_history:0 "Peace to the World!"
 POL_remember_the_history_desc:0 "The Great War claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, and even more were crippled. The old world order has shown its true face and it is our duty to protect future generations to experience such a catastrophe. We must become part of the democratic and anti-imperialist movement and stop the outbreak of a new war at the root."
 POL_militarized_schools:0 "Life Safety"
 POL_militarized_schools_desc:0 "It is necessary to introduce primary military training in schools and universities. Every young man and girl should have the skills to shoot a rifle, provide first aid, navigate the terrain and behave with animals. This way we will educate not just conscious, but also vigilant citizens."
 POL_mobilize_the_proletariat:0 "Civil Defense"
 POL_mobilize_the_proletariat_desc:0 "Without taking measures to prepare the population for protection from the dangers arising from military conflicts, as well as other emergency situations, we risk large losses. Civil defense briefings should be held periodically in the workshop or hall of each institution."
 POL_reogranize_the_society:0 "Reorganization of Society"
 POL_reogranize_the_society_desc:0 "In Poland, almost a quarter of the population remains illiterate. It is necessary to make education an integral part of life by introducing compulsory free school education and increasing the number of teachers. Adults, mostly peasants and the poor, will be able to attend literacy classes."
 
 POL_protection_of_workers_unions:0 "The Reign of the Working Class"
 POL_protection_of_workers_unions_desc:0 "More valuable than our plants and factories can be only those who work for them. We must socially protect the workers of the Polish state, and in order to do this, we guarantee them an eight-hour working day, overtime pay and the legal right to rest."
 POL_autonomy_for_workers_unions:0 "Autonomy of Trade Unions"
 POL_autonomy_for_workers_unions_desc:0 "The workers' state will not be such if it is not governed by workers. We will give the trade unions more power and divide a significant part of the industrial sector between them. This will not only allow us to focus on more important issues, but will also warm up workers' confidence in the government."
 POL_delegalise_strikes_communist:0 "The Fight Against Parasitism"
 POL_delegalise_strikes_communist_desc:0 "It is advantageous for a capitalist to have an army of unemployed people, this allows him to mercilessly exploit a person and pay pennies, threatening that he can be easily replaced. In our country, everyone must be employed and this duty will be prosecuted by law."
 POL_constitutional_duty_of_work:0 "Free Labor"
 POL_constitutional_duty_of_work_desc:0 "Public and social life can lose flexibility and movement if we assign all people to one place of work. It is necessary to allow citizens to work wherever they wish. Maybe this is not a very productive approach, but it is more creative — it will allow us to quickly find the most worthwhile staff."
 POL_industrial_enlightment:0 "Industrial Enlightenment"
 POL_industrial_enlightment_desc:0 "Like Luddites, conservatives consider industrial progress to be something harmful. It is necessary to explain that capitalist relations were harmful — they threw people into the streets, and not the achievements of innovative technologies. We must carry this thought through our entire policy."
 POL_puppet_workers_unions:0 "Direction of Trade Unions"
 POL_puppet_workers_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions are a mechanism of revolution, but in a socialist state there is no need for such unions as a tool for organizing workers to defend their interests. Therefore, their new goal will be to comply with the requirements and fulfill the tasks of the party in the working environment."
 POL_unite_workers_unions_and_government:0 "Working Representation"
 POL_unite_workers_unions_and_government_desc:0 "Representatives of trade unions or other workers' organizations should be present everywhere, from local government bodies to the Council of State. This way we will hear each other better and speed up communication between the administration and enterprises."
 POL_syndycalist_reforms:0 "Trusts and Syndicates"
 POL_syndycalist_reforms_desc:0 "There can be no unprofitable enterprises in our system of socialism, we pay equal attention to everyone. However, our economic organization can be made even better by transferring part of the management to independent associations that are able to meet demand as well as the market."
 POL_communal_land:0 "Communal Land"
 POL_communal_land_desc:0 "Poland is rich in agricultural land, and we will create public land on some of them. The one who will work on communal land is not obliged to report to the state, but at the same time private farms will be deprived of their monopoly. Without a doubt, this fair step will bring us broad support from the peasants."
 POL_centralization_and_discipline:0 "Strict, But Loving"
 POL_centralization_and_discipline_desc:0 "We have reached unprecedented heights in the redistribution of work and property, but we cannot stop. We must follow the highest standards and always be one step ahead. The one who responsibly approaches the performance of his duties and is a role model will be rewarded and honored."
 
 POL_new_five_year_plan:0 "New Five-Year Plan"
 POL_new_five_year_plan_desc:0 "Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski created a wonderful economic plan, as a result of which our country had to acquire a new infrastructure, ports, plants. Having removed Sanation from the way, we can use these initiatives for the development of industry, but now for the benefit of the working people."
 POL_collectivization_of_agriculture:0 "Collectivization of Agriculture"
 POL_collectivization_of_agriculture_desc:0 "In order to fully control our agriculture, we will have to withdraw land holdings from farmers and landlords and reorganize them into public property, which will either belong to the state or to the working collective."
 POL_forced_urbanization:0 "Forced Urbanization"
 POL_forced_urbanization_desc:0 "The project of forced urbanization is not intended to bring discord between the city and the countryside. On the contrary, we strive not only to expand and strengthen our cities, but also to pull the Polish countryside on a par with them."
 POL_transformation_of_nature:0 "Transformation of Nature"
 POL_transformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Our scientists have developed an advanced plan for changing nature, in order to maximize the benefits. We will conduct water channels to the most arid places and grow forest belts near fields that suffer from winds in order to save the harvest. Science will make our homeland a new granary of Europe!"
 POL_centralised_heavy_industry:0 "Centralization of Heavy Industry"
 POL_centralised_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is too dispersed both realistically and organizationally. This area is too important to leave it in such an uncontrolled position. A merger and expansion campaign is required among all such enterprises."
 POL_regional_development:0 "Regional Development"
 POL_regional_development_desc:0 "Those who have been working on their land for many years know the local nature and its features, so there is no need to interfere with their honest work. Perhaps we should simply limit ourselves to prohibiting farms from profiting from wage labor."
 POL_socialist_agrarianism:0 "Socialist Agrarianism"
 POL_socialist_agrarianism_desc:0 "You cannot simply abolish the capitalist way of life and not provide something else in return. The preservation of private farming and other agricultural activities will require the introduction of new trade rules and updated taxation."
 POL_unity_of_men_and_nature:0 "The Unity of Man with Nature"
 POL_unity_of_men_and_nature_desc:0 "Modern man is too out of touch with nature, and dangerous plans to change it can lead to terrible consequences. Let's not break what was created for us. We will allocate special places for which Poland is famous for nature reserves and parks in order to preserve our natural heritage."
 POL_decentralised_heavy_industry:0 "Decentralization of Heavy Industry"
 POL_decentralised_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Belonging of our heavy industry to different administrations is more of a plus than a minus. It is much more convenient for the local leadership to solve issues independently, without waiting for the reaction of the center. If we do not want to lag behind the flexibility and speed of production of the developed capitalist powers, then we need decentralization."
 POL_local_initiatives:0 "Local Initiative"
 POL_local_initiatives_desc:0 "It's time to go further and provide an opportunity for local decision-making not only for large enterprises, but also for small ones, as well as for civil administration. Surely this will entail deviations from the direct course of the party, but it will be another step towards building a truly democratic society."
 
 POL_democracy_in_the_party:0 "Pluralism"
 POL_democracy_in_the_party_desc:0 "The left movement is known for its heterogeneity. It is obvious why, after our social revolution, radical parties started fighting among themselves. This is unacceptable. We risk repeating the fate of Sanation if we do not act as a united front, the foundation for which the PCNL can serve."
 POL_party_discipline:0 "Party Discipline"
 POL_party_discipline_desc:0 "It is extremely difficult to keep several major revolutionary parties in check, which are constantly bickering with each other. It's time to end this farce. We will draw up a code of party discipline, according to which the entire level of discussion will be built."
 POL_militaristic_tendencies:0 "Friendship with the Military"
 POL_militaristic_tendencies_desc:0 "There are people in the Polish officer corps who dislike radicals in general, but are ready to cooperate with us in particular. Having received the support of the military, we will be able not only to stand out among the other parties, but also to convey our position more clearly."
 POL_freedom_of_speech:0 "Freedom of Speech"
 POL_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "An attempt to silence our comrades will only turn them against us. Let's be as open as possible and have a dialogue on the same level! We will not be able to build a people's democracy if we generate malicious critics who discredit us."
 POL_technocratic_tendencies:0 "Technocracy"
 POL_technocratic_tendencies_desc:0 "Capitalism does everything possible to hinder scientific progress by commercializing innovations designed to improve human life. By showing our scientists that in the new Poland they can give free rein to their work and actively supporting them at the same time, we will overtake the profit-hungry imperialists."
 POL_integrate_PNS:0 "Include Red-Brown"
 POL_integrate_PNS_desc:0 "Some time ago, the Party of National Socialists lost its leader — Kazimierz Dagnan — he left for the NSWP. The weakened PNS now has nothing to grab onto, so let's take them into our composition? Patriots-radicals will be able to play in our favor."
 POL_integrate_futurists:0 "Include Futurists"
 POL_integrate_futurists_desc:0 "The ideas of futurists are extreme, but with careful use they can be useful. Any art will be welcome in the society we are building. Without monetization of creativity in favor of the holders of exhibitions and auctions, even the most unrecognized authors will be able to get recognition."
 POL_continue_pluralism_in_party:0 "Democratic Committee"
 POL_continue_pluralism_in_party_desc:0 "Our committee has turned from an ordinary insurgent movement into a strong organizational fist that united people of different professions and different views. Diversity is our strong point, and we must continue the course of pluralism and publicity."
 POL_polish_revolutionary_directorate:0 "VII Department"
 POL_polish_revolutionary_directorate_desc:0 "Radical revolutions are being countered by reaction all over the world. We must be ready not only to fight back against internal enemies, but also to conduct intelligence work abroad, as well as to help those who sympathize with our cause. This will be handled by a special department of the Ministry of Public Security."
 POL_nationalize_foreign_industry:0 "Foreign Means of Production"
 POL_nationalize_foreign_industry_desc:0 "Foreign investment is nothing but the destruction of the results of local labor, because due to the tug-of-war on themselves, investors bury national means of production, leaving no chance for concretion. The way out is the nationalization of these instruments of imperialism for the benefit of the people."
 POL_establish_secret_police:0 "Security Service"
 POL_establish_secret_police_desc:0 "Our revolution needs to be preserved. To do this, we will create a service under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whose task will be to ensure public order, collect information of national importance, counterintelligence, the fight against terrorism and the protection of state borders."
 POL_alliance_with_church:0 "Christian Socialism"
 POL_alliance_with_church_desc:0 "We have an opportunity to put an end to the hostility between radicals and the Christian Church. Not by displacing religion, but by going towards it, finding a connection between the teachings of Jesus Christ and socialism, we can turn our believing population into loyalists of the current government. After all, we all stand for universal values."
 POL_socialist_eucharist:0 "The Church: Identity"
 POL_socialist_eucharist_desc:0 "If we agree with the church not to make anti-government statements to it in exchange for its relatively independent position, we can be calm for the spiritual mood of people. We will leave the church untouched and thereby earn not only the trust, but also the respect of the priests and the primate."
 POL_revolutionary_eucharist:0 "The Church: Consent"
 POL_revolutionary_eucharist_desc:0 "Let us face it: the majority in the Catholic Church does not support us and will push their destructive position. There is no other option for us but to put pressure on it and force it to broadcast pro-government rhetoric. We will replace every unwanted priest if we have to."
 POL_christian_socialist_realism:0 "Christian Socialist Realism"
 POL_christian_socialist_realism_desc:0 "We can combine the aesthetic expression of a radically conscious concept of the world and man, called socialist realism, with our national culture. Contemporary art will be represented in the agitation of the struggle for the establishment and creation of a new society."
 POL_integrate_SCh:0 "Include Agrarians"
 POL_integrate_SCh_desc:0 "The Peasant Party is a left-wing agrarian party that advocates for the interests of the rural population. Many of their members went underground after the military coup of 1930, but now they can safely declare themselves. We are even ready to accept them into our membership in order to increase popular support!"
 POL_reform_into_pzpr:0 "There is Strength in Unity"
 POL_reform_into_pzpr_desc:0 "The PCNL played an excellent role in creating a broad left front, but unfortunately, it will not be able to exist in its current form, sooner or later factionalism will tear it apart from the inside. It's time to transform the committee into a full-fledged party and all together choose a single course that the country should follow."
 POL_integrate_anarchists:0 "Include Anarchists"
 POL_integrate_anarchists_desc:0 "Anarchists want the same communism, but here and now. They will not be so dangerous if we clearly explain that the repressive apparatus of the state, its monopoly on the use of violence and the adoption of laws is in the hands of the working class, which means that we are as close as possible to a classless society and the abolition of the state."
 POL_dictatorship_of_proletariat:0 "The Proletarian Dictatorship"
 POL_dictatorship_of_proletariat_desc:0 "Dictatorship under capitalism and socialism is fundamentally different: in the first case, it is the power of the privileged majority over the minority, and in the second, it is a form of political power in which the class of wage workers establishes its dominance. Everyone should understand this!"
 POL_unquestionable_role_of_mister_chairman:0 "The Undeniable Role of the Chairman"
 POL_unquestionable_role_of_mister_chairman_desc:0 "We make all decisions together, we are like a collective president. But there is someone who represents the personification of the government, the country and the entire Polish people. This person is the chairman of the party, the one who bears the burden for the honor and dignity of our glorious motherland."
 
 POL_get_rid_of_opium_for_masses:0 "Burn Opium"
 POL_get_rid_of_opium_for_masses_desc:0 "If from the very beginning religion carried an educational and even artistic value, then having survived to our times, it has degenerated into a tool for managing people, into their forced, but invisible impoverishment. It's time to wrap up this story. From now on, Poland is declared an atheist state."
 POL_nationalize_churchs_property:0 "Assign Church Wealth"
 POL_nationalize_churchs_property_desc:0 "Naturally, we will return all the church land to the people. Palaces of culture, houses of creativity, clubs and museums will grow out of gloomy temples. But material property is only a part of what the church is rich in. The most important thing is to stop the religious education of young people, for which we will need to replace it with a class and politically correct approach."
 POL_cult_of_the_revolution:0 "Class Consciousness"
 POL_cult_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The workers themselves must decide their fate and self-organize in case the party suddenly retreats from the class struggle and goes to compromise. We must trust our thinkers and leaders, but above all we must believe in ourselves and the revolution. The lower classes of society are the basis of any system, they can move mountains if they only want to."
 POL_propaganda_at_its_finest:0 "Agitation and Propaganda"
 POL_propaganda_at_its_finest_desc:0 "We should not be interested in the bare facts, we should be interested in their causes and consequences. The peoples of the whole world need to be taught to ask the right questions: who benefits from human suffering, what are their interests and whether they will not change their homeland at the same hour as the revolution looms on the horizon? Because the truth is always the same."
 POL_cult_of_the_wodz:0 "The First Among Equals"
 POL_cult_of_the_wodz_desc:0 "Faith in any abstract idea can be easily shaken than devotion to a living concrete person. First of all, you need to trust the one who directs the revolution with his own work, and then its theorists. Our head will receive the status of a leader who unites us all in a single aspiration."
 POL_centrally_planned_economy:0 "Unitary Planned Economy"
 POL_centrally_planned_economy_desc:0 "Even large corporations in the most liberal countries should resort to business management plans. This is another proof of the advantage of the command economy over the market economy, which is free only in words. From now on, our entire economic sector will be subject to the state plan."
 POL_centrally_planned_art:0 "Expression of Pride"
 POL_centrally_planned_art_desc:0 "The people should know their heroes — this is not only our beloved leader, but also important party and military functionaries who should be immortalized in monuments, songs, paintings. The same honor will be awarded to citizens who have made an undeniable contribution to science, art, labor and the defense of the motherland."
 POL_centrally_planned_man:0 "All as One"
 POL_centrally_planned_man_desc:0 "We, the new people, must not only be able to work together, but also stand up for the results of our work.

 POL_centrally_planned_selection:0 "Health and Sports Culture"
 POL_centrally_planned_selection_desc:0 "A doctor is too noble a profession to be approached with problems that can be corrected by the presence of spirit and willpower. This is especially true for young people. Through kindergartens up to the army, we will carry and show the image of a healthy and strong person who takes care of himself and exercises."
 POL_centrally_planned_society:0 "Moral Code of the Radical"
 POL_centrally_planned_society_desc:0 "A set of principles of radical morality should replace the decrepit Catholic thinking, which should be followed by any member of the party. Its main provisions will be dedication to the cause, work for the benefit of society, comradely mutual assistance, intolerance to racial hostility and intransigence to the enemies of the revolution."
 POL_centrally_planned_reality:0 "The Path to Communism"
 POL_centrally_planned_reality_desc:0 "Our leader has led us through difficulties, but even more difficulties lie ahead; but while he is alive, we have the opportunity to say «thank you» to him. Together we have paved the way for a new society that our children and their children's children will follow — a society of freedom, equality and fraternity."
 
 POL_encourage_class_war:0 "Irreconcilable Enmity of Classes"
 POL_encourage_class_war_desc:0 "The class war will be waged as long as there is at least one capitalist state on the planet. We cannot allow our people to become carefree and lose their vigilance in our socialist society. One should always be reminded of the intransigence of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and of the need to fight against those who try to fool the workers."
 POL_support_dabrowszczacy:0 "For Our Freedom and Yours"
 POL_support_dabrowszczacy_desc:0 "The world is on fire. Right now, on the fields of war, it is not the nobility and not landlords with usurers who are dying, but ordinary sons and daughters of workers and peasants. We have no right not to show solidarity with our comrades, we will provide them with all possible assistance. Gather an international brigade, the name of Jarosław Dąbrowski it will bear!"
 POL_glorify_mothers:0 "May There Always Be Mama"
 POL_glorify_mothers_desc:0 "The population census shows depressing news: the birth rate has decreased in Poland over the past few years. It's just that social protection is no longer enough, we need to resort to measures to popularize motherhood. We will limit the number of available professions unsuitable for women for a number of reasons, and use an agitprop machine."
 POL_apolitical_army:0 "Apolitical Army"
 POL_apolitical_army_desc:0 "Is it really necessary to push a political agenda into the armed forces? The army is already part of the people for whom we are building socialism. Let the military focus on protecting the borders of the motherland, and we will focus on everything else."
 POL_guerrilla_tactics:0 "Guerrilla Tactics"
 POL_guerrilla_tactics_desc:0 "When it comes to partisans, most often they imagine a war in the occupied territory. But our army could adopt guerrilla tactics for use on foreign soil! Sabotage, disinformation, intelligence and rescue of prisoners — all the same, but with a clear structure and organization."
 POL_country_for_all:0 "Multinational State"
 POL_country_for_all_desc:0 "People of different nationalities live on our common land. Germans, Kashubians, Lithuanians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Jews and others, although they lead their own way of life, are an important part of our country, without them Poland would not be Poland. Respect for someone else's culture is the quality of a true internationalist and radical."
 POL_new_radical_constitution:0 "Radical Constitution"
 POL_new_radical_constitution_desc:0 "Until now, we have used our own program and decrees instead of the suspended constitution of the Kingdom of Poland. Now, after months of hard work, we are ready to present a new fair constitution, in which we emphasize that power in Poland belongs to its working people."
 POL_communist_youth_organisation:0 "Union of Polish Youth"
 POL_communist_youth_organisation_desc:0 "The struggle for the minds of the younger generation is the most important part of the policy of any government.

 POL_slavic_army_of_labour:0 "People's Army"
 POL_slavic_army_of_labour_desc:0 "The army of Sanation and our people's government will not be able to coexist, it is necessary to rotate a lot of influential personnel. Most likely, we will make the situation of the army worse by putting young and inexperienced officers in the old places, but we will protect ourselves from the risk of a possible mutiny."
 POL_glorify_warrioress:0 "Faithful Daughters of the Motherland"
 POL_glorify_warrioress_desc:0 "Breaking the shackles of women is another milestone in socialist construction, but it does not end there. Our women need to be educated as workers, as scientists and even as leaders! Let slaves and servants remain only in old photographs and in the memory of our generation."
 POL_political_commissars_in_army:0 "Military Control"
 POL_political_commissars_in_army_desc:0 "The party is the army's best friend. Every military unit should have a special person who brings this idea to our soldiers. Of course, they may be disliked for lecturing, but in the hour of anxiety, our political commissars and officers will maintain morale and faith in victory."
 POL_anti_guerrilla_tactics:0 "Anti-Guerrilla Tactics"
 POL_anti_guerrilla_tactics_desc:0 "Do not underestimate the cunning of the enemy. We must be ready to defend ourselves from his sabotage attacks and other wrecking actions. To do this, we will need multi-level intelligence, special police detachments with trained dogs, secret informants and undercover agents."
 POL_integrate_minorities:0 "Indestructible Polish People"
 POL_integrate_minorities_desc:0 "How will a man of military age from the hinterland or the diaspora serve in the army if he barely speaks Polish? Along with the teaching of national languages, the official language will be taught in schools in parallel. We will create problems for ourselves if we don't understand each other."
 POL_workers_militia:0 "Volunteer Reserve"
 POL_workers_militia_desc:0 "It happens that the army or the police do not have enough forces to perform their tasks, or they are completely absent. At such moments, the Volunteer Reserve of the Citizens' Militia, consisting of responsible people with a sense of duty, should come to help. The VRCM will also be able to perform the role of military self-organization of citizens in emergency cases."
 
 POL_monarchists_take_power:0 "All Power Belongs to the King!"
 POL_monarchists_take_power_desc:0 "It was necessary to remove the dirty paws of the junta from the Polish crown for a long time, and now we have such an opportunity. Now only two forces are able to return the monarchy to us: the Synarchic Union and the All-State Monarchist Organization; however, after we come to power, we need to be ready for a confrontation between them."
 
 POL_house_of_wettin_continues:0 "New Old Ties"
 POL_house_of_wettin_continues_desc:0 "The House of Wettin, despite its German origin, is very patriotic. They ruled Poland-Lithuania on the basis of an elective monarchy, and in 1813 this house was restored by Napoleon when the Duchy of Warsaw was created. They did not leave our country during the crisis, so they deserve to rule it!"
 POL_reorganization_of_saxon_estates:0 "Reorganization of Saxon Estates"
 POL_reorganization_of_saxon_estates_desc:0 "Due to the fact that the crown in Poland has recently been only nominal, many of the Saxon estates are either rarely used even by friends of our family, or not used at all. In order to breathe life back into these places, we will reorganize them and transfer part of them to the state so that it can use them as schools, orphanages."
 POL_saxon_military_duty:0 "Military Duty"
 POL_saxon_military_duty_desc:0 "Many previous Saxon rulers were also military commanders, and even many current members of the house fought during the Great War. Active military service for our family should be resumed and made mandatory."
 POL_ties_with_windsors:0 "Two Sides of the Same Coin"
 POL_ties_with_windsors_desc:0 "Apart from the fact that Poland and Great Britain fought on the same side during the Great War, the Windsors are just another branch of the Wettyns. It is obvious that our destinies are connected historically, so we are obliged to offer them the hand of friendship."
 POL_direction_towards_west:0 "The Look to the West"
 POL_direction_towards_west_desc:0 "The so-called Pomerania is part of the lands taken from us after the Great War. We must focus on the return of these territories. The whole east of Germany rightfully belongs to Poland, because before the Wendish Crusade there lived many Slavic tribes who spoke the Lechitic language — an ancient version of Polish."
 POL_reverse_ostsiedlung:0 "Reverse Settlement to the East"
 POL_reverse_ostsiedlung_desc:0 "Settlement to the East is a German term meaning the German colonization of eastern territories, including Slavic, Baltic, Hungarian and Romanian lands. Now the main priority should be to reverse this process on the lands of the ancestors of our kind."
 POL_develop_eastern_germany:0 "Development of the New West"
 POL_develop_eastern_germany_desc:0 "With the exception of Berlin, all our new Western voivodeships are not so rich in every sense. The traumas caused by the Great War and the German Civil War will remain there for a long time, so we must pay special attention to the development of these regions."
 POL_accept_the_germans:0 "Reconciliation"
 POL_accept_the_germans_desc:0 "Be that as it may, but the east of Germany became indigenous to the Germans a long time ago, and the people living there had no influence on the deeds of their ancestors. Instead of banishing German culture from these lands, we should focus on the reconciliation of Poles and Germans."
 POL_the_fourth_rome:0 "The Fourth Rome"
 POL_the_fourth_rome_desc:0 "The Wettins were once a very important German family, which was also represented by the electors of the Holy Roman Empire.

 POL_demand_czechia:0 "Claim to Czechia"
 POL_demand_czechia_desc:0 "Czechia was under our control from 1003 to 1004 during the reign of Bolesław I the Brave. This fact and the fact that these lands are inhabited by Slavic Czechs, while they are ruled by German Austrians, have long been used by Polish politicians to base various kinds of claims on these lands. Now we'll do it."
 POL_develop_czechia:0 "Help for Our Slavic Brothers"
 POL_develop_czechia_desc:0 "It was clear why Austria did not support the Czech population, it was simply alien to it. We will send financial assistance here, we will develop the infrastructure and social base. To do what the Austrians did not do will be right and will show our true goals."
 POL_ties_with_habsburgs:0 "Bit by Bit"
 POL_ties_with_habsburgs_desc:0 "Despite the fact that Poland and Austria were enemies during the Great War, in fact they have a lot in common, for example, the wife of King Fryderyk I came from the Austrian Habsburgs.

 POL_healing_the_wounds_of_the_great_war_desc:0 "We may be accused of blackening the memory of our soldiers who fell in the fight against the Austrians, going on friendship with them.

 POL_integrate_the_borderlands:0 "Get the Kresy Back"
 POL_integrate_the_borderlands_desc:0 "The peoples of the Eastern Kresy, that is, the inhabitants of Belarus and Ukraine, do not consider themselves Poles. On the fragments of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, they created their culture, their faith, that's why their resistance to us is so strong. The reintegration of these territories should become a priority, because the longer we delay, the more difficult it will be moderate and subdue them."

 POL_reform_3rd_may_consitution_desc:0 "The Constitution of 3 May was created by Stanisław August Poniatowski in 1791 to prevent the nobility from plundering the country and generally eliminate the shortcomings of the political system.

 POL_catholicism_state_religion:0 "For the Greater Glory of God"
 POL_catholicism_state_religion_desc:0 "Our nation should not be ashamed: Poland has always been the defender of Catholicism and even the whole of Western Europe from threats from the east and south.

 POL_alliance_with_church_monarchist:0 "The New Church Order"
 POL_alliance_with_church_monarchist_desc:0 "The Catholic Church was incredibly weakened during the Sanation period. They have perverted the very essence of our faith, turning it into an instrument of pushing society around in the name of sin. However, now that Poland has returned to its former values, we can release the church from these shackles. We still have time to ask the Lord for forgiveness."
 POL_confiscation_of_jewish_property:0 "Property Segregation"
 POL_confiscation_of_jewish_property_desc:0 "«Apartments are ours, streets are yours» is a Hebrew phrase symbolizing how they treated ordinary Polish city dwellers in the past. And now it hasn't changed at all. People are hungry for justice, we will give it to them by taking away from these racketeers and extortionists all that they have not earned."
 POL_exclude_nobility_from_obligatory_army_service:0 "Optional Service"
 POL_exclude_nobility_from_obligatory_army_service_desc:0 "Is it possible to call into the army those who are destined to rule the country and subjects? We will allow the new Polish gentry to serve only at their own will, because their divine nobility cannot be tainted by human laws."

 POL_exceptions_for_the_nobility_in_the_army_desc:0 "Serf origin officers think they understand the war better than we do. What nonsense! Previously, the king and the nobility led the army with their wise instructions and ruled the greatest empire. Then the gentry was above any army rank, so it will be like this again."
 POL_profesional_army:0 "The Noble Army"
 POL_profesional_army_desc:0 "We cannot allow corruption and nepotism to rule our army. If blue blood flows in you, then fate obliges you to serve your fatherland and your king! This service is not for selfish interests, but for the highest goal, and the unworthy simply cannot cope with it."
 POL_women_in_military_monarchist:0 "Flowers for War"
 POL_women_in_military_monarchist_desc:0 "We can oppose the division of men's rights with women as much as we like, but the course of history simply leaves us no choice.

 POL_path_towards_racial_purity:0 "One Polish Blood"
 POL_path_towards_racial_purity_desc:0 "Will we be able to call Poland such in fifty years? No, because right now Polish blood is being diluted with foreign blood that does not belong to these lands. At first our children will be half-bloods, and then they will not be Slavs at all! The ASMO proposes to resolutely get rid of the threat of the destruction of the nation."
 POL_free_market_economy:0 "The Invisible Hand of the Market"
 POL_free_market_economy_desc:0 "The monarchy should stop fearing the bourgeoisie as a result of republican revolutions.

 POL_attract_foreign_funds:0 "Attract Funds"
 POL_attract_foreign_funds_desc:0 "An important part of capitalism is its investment opportunities.

Our rich country definitely has something to offer!"
 POL_women_in_parlament:0 "Women Politicians"
 POL_women_in_parlament_desc:0 "We have a chance to take advantage of the struggle of synarchists and the ASMO to introduce some progressive reforms.

 POL_noble_titles_for_women:0 "Titles for Everyone"
 POL_noble_titles_for_women_desc:0 "It is unfair that only men can receive and inherit titles. It doesn't matter how God created you, it's important what your family and you have done for the motherland. Sometimes, women of high ranks are more valuable than a dozen of the same men, and the history of mankind only confirms this."
 POL_socialist_kingdom:0 "Social State"
 POL_socialist_kingdom_desc:0 "Many left-wing politicians have joined our government since the military was removed from power, while the ASMO and synarchists were busy fighting and became marginalized.

 POL_healthcare_reform:0 "Royal Healthcare"
 POL_healthcare_reform_desc:0 "The king and the nobility have at their disposal the best doctors and the best medicines, while our subjects suffer from a lack of medical care.

 POL_limited_rights_for_religious_minorities:0 "Main Religion"
 POL_limited_rights_for_religious_minorities_desc:0 "A balanced approach is the best solution. We cannot give preference to any one religion, but the Polish way of life is based on Catholic values. We will allow some religious minorities to exist, but we will not allow them to become a majority."
 POL_deal_with_jews:0 "An Unholy Alliance"
 POL_deal_with_jews_desc:0 "Jews have become a significant part of our society, we cannot simply «exclude» them. However, our other citizens do not think so.

 POL_equality_of_race:0 "Race Doesn't Matter"
 POL_equality_of_race_desc:0 "In order to ensure the stability of our large state, we must grant citizens of a different nationality of Poland equal rights with the rest.

 POL_mixed_economy:0 "Mixed Economy"
 POL_mixed_economy_desc:0 "We have already seen what happens when, during a crisis, the market is forced to give up position after position, completely or partially paralyzing the economy and the political system. To stop this shortcoming, we will introduce state control of key aspects of economic life, so as not to wait for it to heal itself."
 POL_every_adult_men_in_parlament:0 "Monetary Advantage"
 POL_every_adult_men_in_parlament_desc:0 "Every adult male should have the right to participate in political life. After he deserves it, of course. But those who own large businesses in our country should have a special representation and lobby, because these people hold in their hands everything on which the modern state stands."
 POL_increasing_the_distribution_of_noble_titles:0 "A Broad Caste of the Nobility"
 POL_increasing_the_distribution_of_noble_titles_desc:0 "Poland has always been a country with a large number of nobles. If in France only one percent of the population were nobles, then in Poland this figure was about eight to ten percent. After the reforms of Jerzy I and Fryderyk I, the use of titles on such a scale was discontinued. These reforms should be reversed."
 POL_enpower_bourgeoisie:0 "The Power of Big Capital"
 POL_enpower_bourgeoisie_desc:0 "The measures taken in favor of our and foreign capitalists have brought many right-wing politicians into our ranks. While monarchists and synarchists are mired in an endless showdown, Poland has actually become a kingdom with laws focused on entrepreneurs, landowners and businessmen."
 POL_reintroduce_liberum_veto:0 "Liberum Veto"
 POL_reintroduce_liberum_veto_desc:0 "The old law of the «free veto» states that any deputy of the Sejm can stop discussing the issue in the Sejm and the work of the Sejm in general by opposing. Most of our historians claim that this law led the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to collapse and divisions, but the ASMO insists on the reorganization of this law and the revival of democracy in parliament."
 POL_build_up_highways:0 "Big Road Project"
 POL_build_up_highways_desc:0 "Infrastructure, roads and railways link our cities into one big web, which contributes to the development and improvement of trade.

 POL_help_lower_class:0 "Public Works"
 POL_help_lower_class_desc:0 "Our country is known for its wide class of unemployed population.

 POL_only_nobility_in_the_parlament_desc:0 "How can commoners be trusted to run the state? It may seem fair to radical savages, but just look at the devastation they bring with them! No, Poland is famous for its proud nobility and great gentry, and therefore they should be the support of our king and no one else."
 POL_bring_back_patriarchy:0 "A Man's Word is Law"
 POL_bring_back_patriarchy_desc:0 "In the glorious times before the partitions, the word of a man was the key in the family and was not subject to debate. Now we have become apathetic and sluggish, listening to the «enlightened society», which tells us that natural life should bend under weakness. We will officially write the patriarchate into law — so we will always have the last word for ourselves."
 POL_king_only_figurehead:0 "Our Nominal Figure"
 POL_king_only_figurehead_desc:0 "The king is just an obstacle for the nobility. We must act unanimously and pass laws that will suppress the king and turn him into a figurehead. This will untie the hands of the Senate, the Sejm and regional Sejmiks, which will decentralize our government, but we will get sufficient support on the ground."
 POL_dissemination_of_sarmatian_myth:0 "New Sarmatians"
 POL_dissemination_of_sarmatian_myth_desc:0 "The idea that we Poles are descended from Sarmatians is widespread among the members of the ASMO. They want to revive this ancient myth and present it to our citizens. But the usefulness of this lies not only in raising and renewing the national spirit of the people, but also in the fact that we will be able to legitimately justify our claims to other countries."
 
 POL_restore_warsaw_confederation:0 "Restoration of the Warsaw Confederation"
 POL_restore_warsaw_confederation_desc:0 "During the military conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, Poland became a haven for all believers, regardless of what their religion was.

 POL_cooperate_with_remnants_of_zadruga_desc:0 "Some of the Zadruga, despite their aggressive economic policy program, are ready to accept the monarchy and cooperate with it.

 POL_encourage_imigration:0 "Encourage Immigration"
 POL_encourage_imigration_desc:0 "After we extinguish the fire of nationalism, and everyone in Poland will treat each other as equals, we will even be able to encourage immigration to the country. This will increase the workforce pool, so we will be able to manage human resources more boldly than before."
 POL_economy_controlled_by_synarch:0 "Synarchic Vision"
 POL_economy_controlled_by_synarch_desc:0 "The capitalist system is often unpredictable and in moments of failures leads to the suffering of both ordinary people and owners.

 POL_cut_off_greedy_nobility_desc:0 "Many nobles are greedy, they put themselves above the fatherland and society.

 POL_disband_parlament:0 "Dissolution of Parliament"
 POL_disband_parlament_desc:0 "Now that we have gained full power, the parliament, consisting of the nobility and other parasitic intermediaries, has lost its relevance and no longer plays any role.

 POL_enpower_masonic_lodges:0 "Masonic Lodges"
 POL_enpower_masonic_lodges_desc:0 "It has long been no secret to us that some members of the government are Freemasons.

In exchange for protection, we will ask them to share their knowledge about human nature and how to better govern the country."
 POL_technocratic_government:0 "Impartial Selection"
 POL_technocratic_government_desc:0 "The king's advisers should not be chosen only from people of high rank, because this choice should be based primarily on their competence, not seniority.

 POL_empower_the_synarch:0 "Absolute Synarchy"
 POL_empower_the_synarch_desc:0 "Everyone who interfered with us is now retired in the best case, and in the worst — in prison.

 POL_elections_for_new_king_desc:0 "What was to be expected happened: the cowardly Wettins escaped!

 POL_bonaparte_bastard_wins:0 "The Unthinkable Option"
 POL_bonaparte_bastard_wins_desc:0 "Andrzej Colonna-Walewski is the great-grandson of Napoleon Bonaparte, but illegitimate. His great-grandmother was Maria Walewska, Napoleon's favorite mistress, who was also Polish. He came to us when we announced the election of the king, but he has no legitimate claim to the French throne, so choosing him may turn out to be a conflict decision..."
 POL_modern_regime:0 "Revise the Reality"

 POL_build_up_slovakia_desc:0 "The Slovak region is mainly mountains, so industrial development here is difficult to implement, as well as infrastructural.

 POL_expand_slovakian_mines_desc:0 "The subsoil of Slovakia is fraught with a lot of minerals, but due to the complex landscape and the general underdevelopment of the region, the resource extraction there is relatively shallow.

 POL_retake_livonia_desc:0 "Before Russia took over the region, Livonia was part of Poland. Being an important strategic region, it is replete with naval bases, which opens up wide access for operations in the Baltic Sea. A tasty morsel that cannot be left to our enemies!"

 POL_incorporate_livonia_desc:0 "Latvians and Estonians should accept our rule. They can and probably will resist, but we cannot afford them to abstract from our state and must suppress any expression of discontent. In the end, the benefits of having this region offset the human losses."
 POL_polonize_livonia:0 "Baltic Poles"

 POL_autonomus_duchy_of_livonia_desc:0 "In addition to the fact that Livonia is the most remote region of the Commonwealth, which complicates mutual understanding between us, the radical rule there has set Latvians and Estonians against the monarchy in general and against us in particular. We need to fix everything that the Reds have done and reconcile our peoples."
 POL_develop_livonia:0 "Livonian Economic Development"
 POL_develop_livonia_desc:0 "We must pay tribute to the Reds — they really tried, creating an industrial base in Latvia and Estonia, but all this only squeezed the juices out of ordinary people and served the needs of the army.

 POL_legacy_of_sarmatian_myth_desc:0 "The myth of the Sarmatians was an important factor during the Golden age of Poland and the creation of the Polish nobility. The expansion and deepening of this idea due to the heritage of one Iranian tribe, on the basis of which this myth was created, should give us more support among the nobility and gentry to start working on new ambitions."

 POL_spirit_of_nomadic_steppe_cavalary_desc:0 "The Sarmatians were a nomadic people, many of them came to Europe from Asia and fought against the Romans.

 POL_old_eastern_brothers:0 "Distant Kinship"
 POL_old_eastern_brothers_desc:0 "Iranians belong to the same ethnic group as the Sarmatians.

 POL_divide_and_conquer_desc:0 "It is impossible not to pay attention to what is happening around us.

 POL_rising_of_central_powers_desc:0 "We and the fraternal Hungarian people were thrown out of European politics.

 POL_seek_collaboration_desc:0 "We swept through the enemy's land with a formidable force.

 POL_seek_allies_desc:0 "Now we cannot stand alone against the whole power of France, we need more.

 POL_european_cooperation_focus_desc:0 "European wars have never ended in anything but ruin, bitterness and despondency.

 POL_start_army_reform_desc:0 "It's not that our army is weak, but years of waiting have made it obsolete, and the high command is more involved in politics than in the defense of the country.

 POL_navy_reform:0 "Inspection in the Fleet"

 POL_great_fleet:0 "Great Fleet"
 POL_great_fleet_desc:0 "The truth is that the states that had a great fleet have always been successful and expanded their colonial possessions and trade relations, and in our times, a large fleet serves as an instrument of pressure even on the most remote countries. That is why there is no more compelling reason for Poland not to build a large fleet."
 POL_coast_defence:0 "Coastal Defense"

 POL_maritime_defence_fund_desc:0 "The purpose of the Maritime Defence Fund is to expand the Polish Navy by raising funds among our citizens and Poles living abroad.

 POL_ListenToOrliczDreszer_has_not_DreszerDESC:0 "Taking control of a seaborne region is one thing, but landing on an enemy coast is quite another.

 POL_plan_underwater_ORPs:0 "Submarine Armada"

 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_depth_desc:0 "It is impossible to focus only on the firepower and stealth of submarines.

In addition, the overall strength of the structure plays an important role."
 
 POL_land_army_reform:0 "Inspection in the Army"
 POL_land_army_reform_desc:0 "The main instrument of war for our country will always be ground forces, so we must calculate our plans for them with reverence.

 POL_superiority_of_mobility:0 "Excellence in Mobility"

 POL_superiority_of_firepower_desc:0 "Why waste precious time and risk the lives of our soldiers on detours and maneuvers, if the enemy can be crushed by hurricane artillery preparation, after which we have to walk through its destroyed positions? In defense, powerful guns are able to disperse the enemy's forces even before the start of the battle. Such a strategy suggests itself!"
 POL_focus_on_anti_air:0 "Swatters"
 POL_focus_on_anti_air_desc:0 "Let's focus on creating reliable air defense.

 POL_use_big_guns:0 "Big Guns"
 POL_use_big_guns_desc:0 "Railway guns and other heavy artillery can be very useful if we strive to dominate the battlefield, but it will cost a large amount for the budget. This valuable weapon must be carefully maintained and thoroughly guarded, and in the end it will serve us well."

 POL_reorganise_regiments:0 "Reorganization of Regiments"
 POL_reorganise_regiments_desc:0 "The main soldiers' regiments are poorly organized, low-ranking fighters do not shine with discipline, as do most of the personnel.

 POL_superiority_of_planning:0 "Excellence in Planning"
 POL_superiority_of_planning_desc:0 "Calculate the forces, the level of material support, predict the weather, develop a backup plan and double-check again — all our commanders should think in this way.

 POL_expand_our_defence:0 "Expand Our Defense"
 POL_expand_our_defence_desc:0 "Many are ready to reject the idea of erecting large-scale defensive fortifications, looking back at the experience of the Great War.

 POL_superiority_of_mass:0 "Excellence in Numbers"
 POL_superiority_of_mass_desc:0 "The key to a stable front is the stable position of the troops on it. If we allow the enemy to break through in key places and shackle our forces, there will be little use from modern weapons or new-fangled tactics. We must be able to use reserves in time and close any gap in the defense, and for this we will need modern plans for the mobilization and training of recruits."
 POL_class_a_rezervists:0 "Class A Reservists"
 POL_class_a_rezervists_desc:0 "It is worth changing the laws for those who must carry a rifle, but for some strange reason does not.

 POL_no_step_back:0 "Barrage Squads"
 POL_no_step_back_desc:0 "In order to prevent stampede and disorganization in the event of enemy superiority, another of the specially trained soldiers will line up behind the main line of operations.

 POL_decentralised_high_command:0 "Will to the Officers"
 POL_decentralised_high_command_desc:0 "The influence of the state on the army has recently become very great.

 POL_wz_35_anti_tank_rifle_desc:0 "Developed by a team led by Józef Maroszek, the Model 35 shoots bullets at a very high speed due to the heavy powder charge and the long barrel of the weapon. When it hits the armor at a right angle, it «sticks» sideways to the armor, and later disintegrates inside, hitting everything with fragments. Let's order an extra hundred of these guns!"
 POL_centralised_high_command:0 "Centralized High Command"
 POL_centralised_high_command_desc:0 "The introduction of democracy into the army may bring undesirable results for us. Now it seems that if we give the officers more autonomy, they will burst out with enthusiasm, but if we turn away, intrigues, rivalry and enmity will be played out behind our backs. The army should be subordinated to the government."
 POL_establish_new_academies:0 "Military Alma Mater"
