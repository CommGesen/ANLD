 ###POLITICAL TREE###
 
 POL_death_of_marshal:0 "Death of the Marshal"
 POL_death_of_marshal_desc:0 "Józef Klemens Piłsudski, Marshal of Poland, has passed away. Now the fate of the country is being decided — whether the old order will be continued or a new one will begin. Without a doubt, this opens the door to power for some ambitious figures, no matter how much they mourn our loss."
 
 POL_continue_with_sanation:0 "The Party of Power"
 POL_continue_with_sanation_desc:0 "The government has no nobler task than to continue the work of our first General Inspector. There are people who are ready to inherit the great responsibility of healing society - to inherit Sanation."
 
 POL_smigly_wins:0 "Edward Rydz-Śmigły"
 POL_smigly_wins_desc:0 "Rydz-Śmigły is an ideal candidate for the role of Marshal. This is a person with experience in both the army and aviation, who is not afraid to make difficult decisions. If we want not only to protect Poland, but also to restore it to its former greatness, then we need Edward."
 POL_purge_undersirables:0 "Undesirable Elements"
 POL_purge_undersirables_desc:0 "The issue of power has been resolved, but some do not understand it or refuse to understand it. These fools need to be taught a lesson. We will grab the leaders and the most vociferous members of defeatist parties, movements and clubs for the edification of others."
 POL_enforce_patriarchy:0 "Imposition of Patriarchy"
 POL_enforce_patriarchy_desc:0 "Marshal Piłsudski gave many, even too many rights to the female population. Now we understand that it was a mistake. Women should be aware of their place in society — to keep a hearth and home, to give birth to children, to be a support to their husband. Indulging liberals will only bring discord into society."
 POL_teach_about_national_myths_in_schools:0 "The National Myths"
 POL_teach_about_national_myths_in_schools_desc:0 "The myth is not always about fiction. It can be used as motivation, a reason to work and struggle for a grand idea. Even if what we are fighting for never existed, it makes no sense to prove it now and is even dangerous. We will build a new formation and it does not matter whether it grew out of a myth or not."
 POL_national_myth_of_scythian_origin:0 "The Myth of Scythian Origin"
 POL_national_myth_of_scythian_origin_desc:0 "The Scythians are a huge group of nomadic tribes, one of which was the Sarmatians. There are theories about their Iranian and Altan origin, but for us it does not matter. The important thing is that we can trace our origin from them through many documents. Another important aspect is that once the Polish nobility claimed that they are Sarmatians."
 POL_national_myth_of_hyperborea:0 "The Myth of Hyperborea"
 POL_national_myth_of_hyperborea_desc:0 "Our theorists believe that somewhere beyond the Urals, in northern Siberia, is the ancient land of Hyperborea, described by the «Father of History» Herodotus, from where many tribes originate.

 POL_begin_oczyszczenie_project:0 "The Purification Project"
 POL_begin_oczyszczenie_project_desc:0 "Our nation deserves the best fate, but there are those who interfere: the peoples who have artificially flooded our historical homeland, who have no roots here, who claim Polish land. That's enough! It's time to evict them back and liberate the territory that belongs to us by right."
 POL_start_project_in_kashubia:0 "The Project in Kashubia"
 POL_start_project_in_kashubia_desc:0 "Having regained the Kashubian lands, we faced local resistance, mainly German.

In a couple of generations..."
 POL_start_project_in_germany:0 "The Project in Germany"
 POL_start_project_in_germany_desc:0 "The heart of Prussia is in our hands! Now our government faces a difficult task to pacify these wild lands.

 POL_start_project_in_north_east:0 "The Project in the North-East"
 POL_start_project_in_north_east_desc:0 "There are many ethnic minorities living on our fringes with Livonia and Belarus. By teaching children in schools in their own languages, these small communities divide our people and distance themselves from the state. If they want to live in Poland, then they should be kind enough to speak Polish."
 POL_continue_project_in_lithuania:0 "The Project in Lithuania"
 POL_continue_project_in_lithuania_desc:0 "Lithuania is once again united with the Polish state. Unfortunately, the years of independence and the Red Terror turned Lithuanians against us. They have forgotten our common history and culture, but we will be glad to remind them."
 POL_continue_project_in_belarus:0 "The Project in Belarus"
 POL_continue_project_in_belarus_desc:0 "The Belarusian statehood is truly ridiculous. But now that historical justice has prevailed, we can return Polish identity to this region. But first we will have to get out of the way the bandits who annoy our administration."
 POL_start_project_in_south_east:0 "The Project in the South-East"
 POL_start_project_in_south_east_desc:0 "The Ukrainian people living on our territory do not associate themselves with our great state, which is extremely outrageous. It's time to act tough — we will restrict the use of the Ukrainian language in the press, the education system and cultural events."
 POL_continue_project_in_ukraine:0 "The Project in Ukraine"
 POL_continue_project_in_ukraine_desc:0 "Embittered by the whole world, Ukrainian anarchists are no longer in power. We will bring prosperity to this rich land that was once ours.

 POL_project_is_finished:0 "Finish the Project"
 POL_project_is_finished_desc:0 "Our polonization project is nearing completion. And although a lot of police and military resources have been spent, the results of the Purification will be an increase in profits, manpower and loyalty to the authorities. And now let's destroy all unnecessary evidence and reports related to the actions of Polish soldiers in our new territories..."
 POL_contact_nationalist_radicals:0 "National Radicalism"
 POL_contact_nationalist_radicals_desc:0 "The teachings of radical extremists and the state are incompatible. However, there are those in the ranks of the Reds who do not want the overthrow of our power, but its power, although they interpret it differently. We can use these misguided ones by putting pressure on their patriotic feelings."
 POL_force_atheism:0 "State Atheism"
 POL_force_atheism_desc:0 "As they say, religion is the opiate of the masses. Poles are too keen on believing in postulates that are hundreds of years old, like addicts. This does not bring any benefit to the state. We will launch a large anti-religious campaign aimed primarily at the younger generation."
 POL_nationalise_churches:0 "Nationalization of Churches"
 POL_nationalise_churches_desc:0 "If at the beginning of time religion played an educational role, then in the age of machines and electricity it is exceptionally destructive. If we deprive religion of its main food base — churches, we will stop the obscurantism that has lasted for centuries. Everyone should realize that there is no God, there is only Poland and the Marshal!"
 POL_create_ozn:0 "Camp of National Unity"
 POL_create_ozn_desc:0 "After we have cut religion out of the body of society, it is necessary to instill new values in people.

 POL_ensure_complete_political_dominance:0 "Political Purity"
 POL_ensure_complete_political_dominance_desc:0 "It was only necessary to face the issue of power, as comrades in Sanation such as Walery Sławek and Władysław Sikorski ceased to be comrades. To complete the picture of a united and ready Poland, it is necessary to eliminate the main opposition elements that do not cooperate with the Marshal."
 POL_disband_secret_societies:0 "Disband Secret Societies"
 POL_disband_secret_societies_desc:0 "Masons and other secret Jewish groups pose a great danger to our country — many of them infiltrated our previous government and now they want to get this one! They should be banned, and the most influential arrested."
 POL_massive_propaganda_efforts:0 "The Ultimate Truth"
 POL_massive_propaganda_efforts_desc:0 "Just posters and newspapers are not enough, we need to completely rebuild the information space.

The voice of truth must be heard from everywhere."
 POL_teach_about_etatism:0 "Etatism"
 POL_teach_about_etatism_desc:0 "It is unthinkable that foreign companies should take a share in the Polish economy, otherwise it is not our economy at all. It is necessary to develop national capital that can compete with the rest of the world. But since it will take years to cultivate the new bourgeoisie, it is possible to achieve quick results by appropriating the property of others."
 POL_create_sm_ozn:0 "Youth Duty"
 POL_create_sm_ozn_desc:0 "Youth Duty is a youth organization of the CNU. It tells its wards about traditional family and patriotic values, as well as the importance of the army and the Marshal himself. It also prepares them to serve their fatherland — boys to become warriors, and girls to become mothers."
 POL_create_opw_ozn:0 "Camp of Fighting Poland"
 POL_create_opw_ozn_desc:0 "If the enemy sets foot on our land, both old and young will fight for their native land until our glorious army expels the foe back home. A paramilitary and covert organization will help us in this, which will train the civilian population for combat operations and support agent networks in the occupied territories."
 POL_abolish_monarchy:0 "Abolish Monarchy"
 POL_abolish_monarchy_desc:0 "The monarchy as a form of government is clumsy and ineffective, it is obvious why it does not suit our young state.

 POL_cult_of_new_marshal:0 "Marshal's Party"
 POL_cult_of_new_marshal_desc:0 "It should be clear to everyone that the old Sanation has been reborn in our wise marshal. He is our protector and patron, who has taken upon himself the burden of leading the country to greatness, and we will honorably accompany him in this noble cause. From now on and forever: Poland is Sanation, Sanation is the Marshal!"
 POL_use_futurists:0 "Futurism"
 POL_use_futurists_desc:0 "The futurism movement has become widespread in Poland. These people find themselves striving to reflect in their works the acceleration of the pace of life and the industrialization of the milieu as signs of a new era. Based on this, we can conclude that we are not so different, let's find a common language with them."
 POL_nuz_w_bzuhu_smigly:0 "Nuż w Bżuhu"
 POL_nuz_w_bzuhu_smigly_desc:0 "Nuż w bżuhu is a magazine in which many futurist creators publish their... art. No matter how we treat them, their unusual vision of the world largely coincides with ours, so we could use their information resource for our own purposes."
 POL_purge_futurists:0 "Traditional Art"
 POL_purge_futurists_desc:0 "All these avant-gardists are unhealthy people! Not only is it impossible to understand their work, but, most importantly, they are pushing against the traditional way of our society, which goes against our policy. It is necessary to purify art from the harmful influence of futurism and other similar trends."
 POL_concessions_to_christians:0 "Concessions to Christians"
 POL_concessions_to_christians_desc:0 "Perhaps we overreacted with the church reform. After all, Christianity is a conservative religion that can help keep society from falling into anarchy, and that's exactly what we need right now. So why not make some concessions?"
 
 POL_cult_of_old_marshal:0 "Cult of the First Marshal"
 POL_cult_of_old_marshal_desc:0 "Our people will never forget the First Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the great military commander and regent of the Polish state. We will perpetuate the memory of this man and preserve everything that was created by him. He will become the national symbol of the country and we will carry his name through the centuries."
 POL_mobilize_the_masses:0 "Mobilize the Masses"
 POL_mobilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The advantage of mobilization is that every person will be involved in the mechanism of the state, and our economy will find a clear goal and will not become a victim of any crisis. Thus, our power will turn into a military camp, where everyone will know their orders and not ask unnecessary questions."
 POL_state_that_gives:0 "The Welfare State"

 POL_crush_decadency:0 "Crush Decadence"
 POL_crush_decadency_desc:0 "We have already inspired people enough to work for the common good, but there is something that hinders — this is a nationwide mood of decline.

 POL_fund_galleries_of_patriotic_art:0 "Patriotic Art Galleries"
 POL_fund_galleries_of_patriotic_art_desc:0 "It is possible to awaken mass consciousness with a new direction in art. A series of patriotic posters and the sponsorship of our artists will spur public sentiment. These works should inspire pride to us, and trembling to the enemies."
 
 POL_sikorski_wins:0 "Władysław Sikorski"
 POL_sikorski_wins_desc:0 "Although Sikorsky did not always agree with our beloved Marshal, he has zeal, and most importantly talent. He is a diligent officer and a true patriot. Who, if not him, will be able to protect our Poland from the tornado of uncertainty that is now dragging the world?"
 POL_culture_not_race:0 "Culture, not Race"
 POL_culture_not_race_desc:0 "Poland is a multinational state. If we divide its citizens by race, we will not only deprive ourselves of human resources, but also sow distemper. Instead of simply expunging small nations from our lives, we will propose to the government a plan for their acculturation."
 POL_start_cultural_integration:0 "Cultural Integration"
 POL_start_cultural_integration_desc:0 "Replacing the culture of small nations with our culture is cruel, but if we want to preserve and strengthen the unity of the people, this act is justified. It is important that future generations will not regret this and they will accept reality as it will be."
 POL_partly_free_elections:0 "Limited Elections"
 POL_partly_free_elections_desc:0 "An unambiguous dictatorship is not the most prudent idea.

 POL_promote_political_activness:0 "Political Life of Society"
 POL_promote_political_activness_desc:0 "Some believe that the participation of the people in politics is a dangerous thing.

 POL_freedom_of_religion:0 "Freedom of Religion"
 POL_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "In fact, our country rarely had problems with believers. This is what distinguishes us from other powers whose unity is based on religion, when we are united by the spirit of the people. That's why they call us the country without stakes — we have never executed for worshipping other gods and so it will continue."
 POL_equality_of_man_and_woman:0 "Equality of Man and Woman"
 POL_equality_of_man_and_woman_desc:0 "Not only men are capable of performing great feats. History knows a lot about women whose deeds surpassed men's fame.

 POL_allow_and_encourage_woman_in_military:0 "Women in the Military"
 POL_allow_and_encourage_woman_in_military_desc:0 "Polish women are free to work for the good of our country, but they cannot perform military service because of entrenched stereotypes and arrogant male power. To turn a blind eye to this means to deprive ourselves of new soldiers and officers, and we are not in a position to allow ourselves such a luxury."
 POL_establish_honor_i_ojczyzna:0 "Honour and Fatherland"
 POL_establish_honor_i_ojczyzna_desc:0 "Our officers, including generals and marshals, remain scattered and true to their personal beliefs. The organization Honour and Fatherland will be able to consolidate all military aspirations and interrupt disagreements in the ranks of the armed forces."
 POL_invite_ND_to_government:0 "Invite National Democracy"
 POL_invite_ND_to_government_desc:0 "National Democracy or Endecja is a right-wing nationalist party, whose slogans largely coincide with the vision of our Marshal. They are democratic enough to create the appearance of a fair system and not radical enough to put a spoke in the wheel."
 POL_emphasize_catholic_values:0 "Catholic Values"
 POL_emphasize_catholic_values_desc:0 "We tolerate any religion, but the majority of the population in our country are Catholics, and the government itself is pro-Catholic, so it would be logical to support the dominant role of Catholicism, which has accompanied Poland for many centuries."
 POL_encourage_priests_in_military:0 "Priests in the Military"
 POL_encourage_priests_in_military_desc:0 "The system of military chaplains of the Polish Military is currently in a deplorable state since the Great War because of the indifferent attitude of the Piłsudski system to it. Both the Endecja and the Catholic Church demand reform, and the positive thing is that the latter are ready to take on most of the costs we need to implement it."
 POL_religion_in_schools:0 "Religion in Schools"
 POL_religion_in_schools_desc:0 "Religious teaching has always been an unofficial part of our education system. Since the public school system is in a very deplorable state, the Catholic Church plays a significant role in its maintenance. Our allies from Endecja can help, but in return they ask for an official role for the church in the education system."
 POL_catholic_school_reform:0 "Catholic Education"
 POL_catholic_school_reform_desc:0 "After the last education reform, it became quite obvious that the Catholic Church has more influence than we thought. Now the church wants us to reform the current national curriculum and make Catholic education a mandatory part of the system."
 POL_invite_PSL_to_government:0 "Invite the People's Party"
 POL_invite_PSL_to_government_desc:0 "The People's Party is a merger of small agrarian parties, which advocates strengthening the positions of the peasantry in politics. By sharing government positions with them, we could use their resources to solve pressing problems."
 POL_increase_social_grants:0 "Social Grants"
 POL_increase_social_grants_desc:0 "Since the Great War, the social security and school education system has been in a terrible state.

 POL_nationalist_school_reform:0 "Nationalist School Reform"

 POL_increase_agrarian_founds_desc:0 "Objectively, the state of our rural areas is not at the level of Western European countries.

 POL_better_living_conditions_for_countryside:0 "New Rural Standards"
 POL_better_living_conditions_for_countryside_desc:0 "The biggest problem of rural areas is relatively low living conditions.

 POL_make_deal_with_king:0 "Deal with the King"
 POL_make_deal_with_king_desc:0 "Fryderyk Krystian II is not an obstacle to the Sanation government. We can use the young king for our purposes by handing him only nominal power. We will play monarchy as long as people like it."
 
 POL_stachniuk_wins:0 "Jan Stachniuk"
 POL_stachniuk_wins_desc:0 "«Stoigniew» Stachniuk is a neo-pagan with charm, influence and unusual ideas. He criticizes Christianity and capitalism, and also calls for a return to life in the traditions of the proto-Slavic society. Poland is closer to this ideology than it may seem at first glance, but to prove it, we need to remove the mask of Catholicism from our nation."
 POL_find_support_among_radicals:0 "Radical Support"
 POL_find_support_among_radicals_desc:0 "Some radicals consider our actions to be correct because of the economic program and attitude towards the Catholic Church. We could attract these Reds to work for the new Polish state, and not for a destructive revolution."
 POL_find_support_among_artists:0 "Artists Support"
 POL_find_support_among_artists_desc:0 "There are artists who support our cause, but now they remain unnoticed. But as soon as they find the recognition of the government, they will be able to compete with the current artists."
 
 POL_piasecki_wins:0 "Bolesław Piasecki"
 POL_piasecki_wins_desc:0 "Piasecki is a right-wing radical ideologue who advocates building a Catholic dictatorship in Poland. There is already an autocratic order in our country, and religion plays an important role in the life of society, therefore this idea does not seem so radical..."
 POL_seek_support_from_ND:0 "Endecjan Support"
 POL_seek_support_from_ND_desc:0 "Many members of the National Democracy share our views on the future of Poland.

 POL_keep_friends_from_above_baltic_desc:0 "In the ancient times of the migration of peoples, the Balts and Slavs were one group. Later, when they moved from nomadism to a sedentary lifestyle in Eastern Europe, they split up. Our government should focus on restoring its former unity."

 POL_ONR_takes_over_desc:0 "The indecisive actions of Sanation led to the weakening of the Polish state and attacks on the church, but now that our internal enemies have disappeared, the National Radical Camp Falanga can take full power into its own hands and announce the transformation of the existing system."
 POL_falanga_and_monarch:0 "We and the Monarch"

 POL_the_third_way:0 "The Third Way"
 POL_the_third_way_desc:0 "It is obvious that the capitalist system cannot withstand the pressure of time and collapses, however, the socialists with their radical ideology would rather drive the world into the grave than fix it. Survival is guaranteed only by balance."

 POL_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "The unification of nationalism and syndicalism created the philosophy of resolving the conflict between capitalism and socialism by creating a new system of economic organization based on self-governing corporations or syndicates.

 POL_falangist_corporatism_desc:0 "In our country, any job is important, regardless of whether it is physical or mental.

 POL_catholic_youth_organisations_desc:0 "If we want to leave behind a future, we need to create a foundation for it. The Polish Scouting and Guiding Association — our national Scout organization — needs to be given more resources and given a new goal.

 POL_unite_with_onr_abc_desc:0 "After the May 1930 coup, many members of the NRC joined Piłsudski, and then created the Falanga — what we are now, while others created their own wing of the party — the NRC-ABC, and later switched to the National Democrats altogether.

 POL_create_new_type_of_man_desc:0 "To show what an exemplary Pole should be, we will create a propaganda image of a new man! If it is a male, then he should be stately, fit, work hard or serve; if it is a female, then she should take care of children, be a housewife and pretty."

 POL_return_of_crusades:0 "Return to the Crusades"
 POL_return_of_crusades_desc:0 "We have defended Catholicism at home, but Poland is surrounded by a whole Christian civilization that is suffering under the yoke of autocrats.

 POL_retake_palestine_desc:0 "In 1364, King Peter I of Cyprus asked King Casimir III of Poland to organize a crusade. This proposal was rejected due to domestic problems. However, now it frees our hands, because we can use these facts for legitimate claims to the Holy Land."

 POL_our_own_church:0 "Polish National Catholic Church"
 POL_our_own_church_desc:0 "Poles should prevail in the Catholic hierarchy of Poland, as well as services should be conducted in Polish. Back in 1551, Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski spoke about this in his work «On the Improvement of the State», where he advocated the creation of a Polish church. This will inevitably lead to a schism and place great responsibility on us."
 POL_vatican_support:0 "Support from the Papal See"
 POL_vatican_support_desc:0 "We have given Palestine to the See, and now we plan to receive the full support of the Catholic Church.

 POL_export_catholicism_abroad_desc:0 "We can condemn heretics and sinners as much as we like, but are they worthy of such a life?

 POL_destroy_fake_pope:0 "The End of Vatican Power"
 POL_destroy_fake_pope_desc:0 "The Vatican can make anyone who does not adhere to the general line an outcast, it decides which church is right and which is not.

 POL_our_own_pope:0 "Election of a New Pope"
 POL_our_own_pope_desc:0 "Now nothing prevents us from assembling our own conclave to elect a Pope. This will be a blow to the adherents of the old Roman denomination and a new page in the history of Poland, in which it becomes the mainstay of all true Catholics."

 POL_start_army_reform:0 "Military Reform"
 POL_start_army_reform_desc:0 "It's not that our army is weak, but years of waiting have made it obsolete, and the high command is more involved in politics than in the defense of the country. The Polish Military urgently needs to be put on its feet! The sooner we start reforming the armed forces, the better."
 
 POL_navy_reform:0 "Inspection in the Fleet"
 POL_navy_reform_desc:0 "It is necessary to monitor the implementation of the reform in the fleet. Selfish minds believe that if our Navy is small, then you can leave it to its fate. Difficult times are approaching, and now more than ever it is important to keep our ships ready."
 POL_great_fleet:0 "Great Fleet"
 POL_great_fleet_desc:0 "The truth is that the states that had a great fleet have always been successful and expanded their colonial possessions and trade relations, and in our times, a large fleet serves as an instrument of pressure even on the most remote countries. That is why there is no more compelling reason for Poland not to build a large fleet."
 POL_coast_defence:0 "Coastal Defense"
 POL_coast_defence_desc:0 "While working on improving the fleet, in parallel it is necessary to develop a plan to protect the coast in case of an enemy invasion. We will place strong points for our garrisons at key points of the coastline."

 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_surface:0 "Giants of the Baltic Sea"
 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_surface_desc:0 "The Polish Navy should have no equal in the Baltic! Each individual ship must represent a dangerous force. Such a ship should have all the means to combat aviation, surface and submarine fleets, as well as be able to fire at the enemy on land."
 POL_maritime_defence_fund:0 "Maritime Defence Fund"
 POL_maritime_defence_fund_desc:0 "The purpose of the Maritime Defence Fund is to expand the Polish Navy by raising funds among our citizens and Poles living abroad.

 POL_expand_river_flotillas_desc:0 "Our vast rivers allow them to be used not only in civil and commercial shipping, but also in military.

 POL_hidden_fleet:0 "Hidden Fleet"
 POL_hidden_fleet_desc:0 "Poland has never had a naval armada — it happened historically, but our small fleet can be turned into an advantage: we will bet on predatory submarines and fast surface ships that can reach any edge of the Baltic Sea and even beyond!"

 POL_ListenToOrliczDreszer_has_not_DreszerDESC:0 "Taking control of a seaborne region is one thing, but landing on an enemy coast is quite another.

In addition, such people will be useful not only for amphibious assault, but also for forcing rivers and other difficult terrain."
 POL_plan_underwater_ORPs:0 "Submarine Armada"
 POL_plan_underwater_ORPs_desc:0 "Since we have little reason to create a great fleet, we should focus on something achievable — on a high-quality submarine fleet! Our submarines should have the potential to destroy any enemy."
 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_depth:0 "Perfect Machines"
 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_depth_desc:0 "It is impossible to focus only on the firepower and stealth of submarines. Our equipment should be autonomous enough so that the crew can spend as much time at sea or under water as possible if it is not possible to leave the battle or return to base. In addition, the overall strength of the structure plays an important role."
 
 POL_land_army_reform:0 "Inspection in the Army"
 POL_land_army_reform_desc:0 "The main instrument of war for our country will always be ground forces, so we must calculate our plans for them with reverence.

 POL_superiority_of_mobility:0 "Excellence in Mobility"
 POL_superiority_of_mobility_desc:0 "The Great War showed the ineffectiveness of positional warfare, but the fastest ground troops of that time did not have the necessary protection to upset the enemy's ranks. Hence the conclusion that the way to victory is fast armored mechanized troops."

The Polish husaria will be reborn in these machines!"
 POL_superiority_of_firepower:0 "Excellence in Firepower"
 POL_superiority_of_firepower_desc:0 "Why waste precious time and risk the lives of our soldiers on detours and maneuvers, if the enemy can be crushed by hurricane artillery preparation, after which we have to walk through its destroyed positions? In defense, powerful guns are able to disperse the enemy's forces even before the start of the battle. Such a strategy suggests itself!"
 POL_focus_on_anti_air:0 "Anti-Aircraft Defense"
 POL_focus_on_anti_air_desc:0 "Let's focus on creating reliable air defense.

 POL_use_big_guns:0 "Big Guns"
 POL_use_big_guns_desc:0 "Railway guns and other heavy artillery can be very useful if we strive to dominate the battlefield, but it will cost a large amount for the budget. This valuable weapon must be carefully maintained and thoroughly guarded, and in the end it will serve us well."
 POL_focus_on_normal_artillery:0 "Gods of War"
 POL_focus_on_normal_artillery_desc:0 "We are interested in quantity and quality. We must make sure that every commander has a connection with the artillery, and the gunners themselves have a lot of lethal guns capable of removing everything and everyone from the path of our valiant army."
 POL_reorganise_regiments:0 "Reorganization of Regiments"
 POL_reorganise_regiments_desc:0 "The main soldiers' regiments are poorly organized, low-ranking fighters do not shine with discipline, as do most of the personnel.

 POL_superiority_of_planning:0 "Excellence in Planning"
 POL_superiority_of_planning_desc:0 "Calculate the forces, the level of material support, predict the weather, develop a backup plan and double-check again — all our commanders should think in this way.

 POL_expand_our_defence:0 "Expand Our Defense"
 POL_expand_our_defence_desc:0 "Many are ready to reject the idea of erecting large-scale defensive fortifications, looking back at the experience of the Great War.

 POL_special_training_for_engineers:0 "Special Training of Engineers"
 POL_special_training_for_engineers_desc:0 "We will increase the number of engineering staff, as well as their training time.

 POL_prepare_to_fast_expansion_of_logistics_desc:0 "The further the supply is from the center, the worse it gets.

 POL_increase_planning_possibilites_desc:0 "Military officials should be prepared for all difficulties that their subordinates may face.

 POL_superiority_of_mass:0 "Excellence in Numbers"
 POL_superiority_of_mass_desc:0 "The key to a stable front is the stable position of the troops on it. If we allow the enemy to break through in key places and shackle our forces, there will be little use from modern weapons or new-fangled tactics. We must be able to use reserves in time and close any gap in the defense, and for this we will need modern plans for the mobilization and training of recruits."
 POL_class_a_rezervists:0 "Class A Reservists"
 POL_class_a_rezervists_desc:0 "It is worth changing the laws for those who must carry a rifle, but for some strange reason does not. We have a lot of people fit for military service under our noses, it remains only to include them in the general army program and we will get a solid increase in personnel."
 POL_no_step_back:0 "Barrage Squads"
 POL_no_step_back_desc:0 "In order to prevent stampede and disorganization in the event of enemy superiority, another of the specially trained soldiers will line up behind the main line of operations.

 POL_mass_produce_rifles:0 "Mass Produce Rifles"
 POL_mass_produce_rifles_desc:0 "There are never many weapons. The government should direct all efforts to large-scale production of regular and personal small arms and ammunition. Allowing a shortage of rifles is like sawing a branch on which you are sitting."
