 ###POLITICAL TREE###
 
 POL_death_of_marshal:0 "Death of the Marshal"
 POL_death_of_marshal_desc:0 "Józef Klemens Piłsudski, Marshal of Poland, has passed away. Now the fate of the country is being decided — whether the old order will be continued or a new one will begin. Without a doubt, this opens the door to power for some ambitious figures, no matter how much they mourn our loss."
 
 POL_continue_with_sanation:0 "The Party of Power"
 POL_continue_with_sanation_desc:0 "The government has no nobler task than to continue the work of the General Inspector. There are people who are ready to inherit the great responsibility of healing society - to inherit Sanation."
 
 POL_smigly_wins:0 "Edward Rydz-Śmigły"
 POL_smigly_wins_desc:0 "Rydz-Śmigły is an ideal candidate for the role of Marshal. This is a person with experience in both the army and aviation, who is not afraid to make difficult decisions. If we want not only to protect Poland, but also to restore it to its former greatness, then we need Edward."
 POL_purge_undersirables:0 "Undesirable Elements"
 POL_purge_undersirables_desc:0 "The issue of power has been resolved, but some do not understand it or refuse to understand it. These fools need to be taught a lesson. We will grab the leaders and the most vociferous members of defeatist parties, movements and clubs for the edification of others."
 POL_enforce_patriarchy:0 "Imposition of Patriarchy"
 POL_enforce_patriarchy_desc:0 "Marshal Piłsudski gave many, even too many rights to the female population. Now we understand that it was a mistake. Women should be aware of their place in society — to keep a hearth and home, to give birth to children, to be a support to their husband. Indulging liberals will only bring discord into society."
 POL_teach_about_national_myths_in_schools:0 "The National Myths"
 POL_teach_about_national_myths_in_schools_desc:0 "The myth is not always about fiction. It can be used as motivation, a reason to work and struggle for a grand idea. Even if what we are fighting for never existed, it makes no sense to prove it now and is even dangerous. We will build a new formation and it does not matter whether it grew out of a myth or not."
 POL_national_myth_of_scythian_origin:0 "The Myth of Scythian Origin"
 POL_national_myth_of_scythian_origin_desc:0 "The Scythians are a huge group of nomadic tribes, one of which was the Sarmatians. There are theories about their Iranian and Altan origin, but for us it does not matter. The important thing is that we can trace our origin from them through many documents. Another important aspect is that once the Polish nobility claimed that they are Sarmatians."
 POL_national_myth_of_hyperborea:0 "The Myth of Hyperborea"
 POL_national_myth_of_hyperborea_desc:0 "Our theorists believe that somewhere beyond the Urals, in northern Siberia, is the ancient land of Hyperborea, described by the «Father of History» Herodotus, from where many tribes originate. Poles are one of them and we need to convince the people that this is true!"
 POL_begin_oczyszczenie_project:0 "The Purification Project"
 POL_begin_oczyszczenie_project_desc:0 "Our nation deserves the best fate, but there are those who interfere: the peoples who have artificially flooded our historical homeland, who have no roots here, who claim Polish land.

 POL_start_project_in_kashubia:0 "The Project in Kashubia"
 POL_start_project_in_kashubia_desc:0 "Having regained the Kashubian lands, we faced local resistance, mainly German. But we will give them a choice: let them either return to the west to their barbaric lands, or keep quiet. We will allow those who behave well to integrate into Polish culture. In a couple of generations..."
 POL_start_project_in_germany:0 "The Project in Germany"
 POL_start_project_in_germany_desc:0 "The heart of Prussia is in our hands! Now our Government faces a difficult task to pacify these wild lands. In order to undermine the German spirit, we will take out all valuables, machines and raw materials, as well as assign their property to Polish big business."
 POL_start_project_in_north_east:0 "The Project in the North-East"
 POL_start_project_in_north_east_desc:0 "There are many ethnic minorities living on our fringes with Livonia and Belarus. By teaching children in schools in their own languages, these small communities divide our people and distance themselves from the state. If they want to live in Poland, then they should be kind enough to speak Polish."
 POL_continue_project_in_lithuania:0 "The Project in Lithuania"
 POL_continue_project_in_lithuania_desc:0 "Lithuania is once again united with the Polish state. Unfortunately, the years of independence and the Red Terror turned Lithuanians against us. They have forgotten our common history and culture, but we will be glad to remind them."
 POL_continue_project_in_belarus:0 "The Project in Belarus"
 POL_continue_project_in_belarus_desc:0 "The Belarusian statehood is truly ridiculous. But now that historical justice has prevailed, we can return Polish identity to this region. But first we will have to get out of the way the bandits who annoy our administration."
 POL_start_project_in_south_east:0 "The Project in the South-East"
 POL_start_project_in_south_east_desc:0 "The Ukrainian people living on our territory do not associate themselves with our great state, which is extremely outrageous. It's time to act tough — we will restrict the use of the Ukrainian language in the press, the education system and cultural events."
 POL_continue_project_in_ukraine:0 "The Project in Ukraine"
 POL_continue_project_in_ukraine_desc:0 "Embittered by the whole world, Ukrainian anarchists are no longer in power. We will bring prosperity to this rich land that was once ours. The locals are planned to be used as labor and servants, and their means of production will be distributed among our companies."
 POL_project_is_finished:0 "Finish the Project"
 POL_project_is_finished_desc:0 "Our polonization project is nearing completion. And although a lot of police and military resources have been spent, the results of the Purification will be an increase in profits, manpower and loyalty to the authorities. And now let's destroy all unnecessary evidence and reports related to the actions of Polish soldiers in our new territories..."
 POL_contact_nationalist_radicals:0 "National Radicalism"
 POL_contact_nationalist_radicals_desc:0 "The teachings of radical extremists and the state are incompatible. However, there are those in the ranks of the Reds who do not want the overthrow of our power, but its power, although they interpret it differently. We can use these misguided ones by putting pressure on their patriotic feelings."
 POL_force_atheism:0 "State Atheism"
 POL_force_atheism_desc:0 "As they say, religion is the opiate of the masses. Poles are too keen on believing in postulates that are hundreds of years old, like addicts. This does not bring any benefit to the state. We will launch a large anti-religious campaign aimed primarily at the younger generation."
 POL_nationalise_churches:0 "Nationalization of Churches"
 POL_nationalise_churches_desc:0 "If at the beginning of time religion played an educational role, then in the age of machines and electricity it is exceptionally destructive. If we deprive religion of its main food base — churches, we will stop the obscurantism that has lasted for centuries. Everyone should realize that there is no God, there is only Poland and the Marshal!"
 POL_create_ozn:0 "Camp of National Unity"
 POL_create_ozn_desc:0 "After we have cut religion out of the body of society, it is necessary to instill new values in people. These will be the values of the new order, which Adam Koc's Camp of National Unity will help us achieve. These guys are fresh and eager to fight, they will stand to the death for our new state."
 POL_ensure_complete_political_dominance:0 "Political Purity"
 POL_ensure_complete_political_dominance_desc:0 "It was only necessary to face the issue of power, as comrades in Sanation such as Walery Sławek and Władysław Sikorski ceased to be comrades. To complete the picture of a united and ready Poland, it is necessary to eliminate the main opposition elements that do not cooperate with the Marshal."
 POL_disband_secret_societies:0 "Disband Secret Societies"
 POL_disband_secret_societies_desc:0 "Masons and other secret Jewish groups pose a great danger to our country — many of them infiltrated our previous government and now they want to get this one! They should be banned, and the most influential arrested."
 POL_massive_propaganda_efforts:0 "The Ultimate Truth"
 POL_massive_propaganda_efforts_desc:0 "Just posters and newspapers are not enough, we need to completely rebuild the information space. We will introduce new materials into the school curriculum, create television and radio broadcasts, even theaters and exhibitions will be politically engaged. The voice of truth must be heard from everywhere."
 POL_teach_about_etatism:0 "Etatism"
 POL_teach_about_etatism_desc:0 "It is unthinkable that foreign companies should take a share in the Polish economy, otherwise it is not our economy at all. It is necessary to develop national capital that can compete with the rest of the world. But since it will take years to cultivate the new bourgeoisie, it is possible to achieve quick results by appropriating the property of others."
 POL_create_sm_ozn:0 "Youth Duty"
 POL_create_sm_ozn_desc:0 "Youth Duty is a youth organization of the OZN. It tells its wards about traditional family and patriotic values, as well as the importance of the army and the Marshal himself. It also prepares them to serve their fatherland — boys to become warriors, and girls to become mothers."
 POL_create_opw_ozn:0 "Camp of Fighting Poland"
 POL_create_opw_ozn_desc:0 "If the enemy sets foot on our land, both old and young will fight for their native land until our glorious army expels the foe back home. A paramilitary and covert organization will help us in this, which will train the civilian population for combat operations and support agent networks in the occupied territories."
 POL_abolish_monarchy:0 "Abolish Monarchy"
 POL_abolish_monarchy_desc:0 "The monarchy as a form of government is clumsy and ineffective, it is obvious why it does not suit our young state. We will eliminate all monarchical and regency institutions that drag our thinking and way of life back to the past. Poland has only one ruler, and that is our glorious Marshal!"
 POL_cult_of_new_marshal:0 "Marshal's Party"
 POL_cult_of_new_marshal_desc:0 "It should be clear to everyone that the old Sanation has been reborn in our wise marshal. He is our protector and patron, who has taken upon himself the burden of leading the country to greatness, and we will honorably accompany him in this noble cause. From now on and forever: Poland is a Sanation, Sanation is a Marshal!"
 POL_use_futurists:0 "Futurism"
 POL_use_futurists_desc:0 "The futurism movement has become widespread in Poland. These people find themselves striving to reflect in their works the acceleration of the pace of life and the industrialization of the milieu as signs of a new era. Based on this, we can conclude that we are not so different, let's find a common language with them."
 POL_nuz_w_bzuhu_smigly:0 "Nuż w Bżuhu"
 POL_nuz_w_bzuhu_smigly_desc:0 "Nuż w bżuhu is a magazine in which many futurist creators publish their... art. No matter how we treat them, their unusual vision of the world largely coincides with ours, so we could use their information resource for our own purposes."
 POL_purge_futurists:0 "Traditional Art"
 POL_purge_futurists_desc:0 "All these avant-gardists are unhealthy people! Not only is it impossible to understand their work, but, most importantly, they are pushing against the traditional way of our society, which goes against our policy. It is necessary to purify art from the harmful influence of futurism and other similar trends."
 POL_concessions_to_christians:0 "Concessions to Christians"
 POL_concessions_to_christians_desc:0 "Perhaps we overreacted with the church reform. After all, Christianity is a conservative religion that can help keep society from falling into anarchy, and that's exactly what we need right now. So why not make some concessions?"
 
 POL_cult_of_old_marshal:0 "The Cult of the First Marshal"
 POL_cult_of_old_marshal_desc:0 "Our people will never forget the First Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the great military commander and regent of the Polish state. We will perpetuate the memory of this man and preserve everything that was created by him. He will become the national symbol of the country and we will carry his name through the centuries."
 POL_mobilize_the_masses:0 "Mobilize the Masses"
 POL_mobilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The advantage of mobilization is that every person will be involved in the mechanism of the state, and our economy will find a clear goal and will not become a victim of any crisis. Thus, our power will turn into a military camp, where everyone will know their orders and not ask unnecessary questions."
 POL_state_that_gives:0 "The Welfare State"
 POL_state_that_gives_desc:0 "What kind of army can there be on the scale of the whole country if it is without proper support? Improving the quality of education and healthcare is our priority. We will succeed only by high standards!"
 POL_crush_decadency:0 "Crush Decadence"
 POL_crush_decadency_desc:0 "We have already inspired people enough to work for the common good, but there is something that hinders — this is a nationwide mood of decline. Cultural emptiness is very common, and even worse, it can be filled with immoralism, individualism. We need to stop the penetration of Western rot into our lives."
 POL_fund_galleries_of_patriotic_art:0 "Patriotic Art Galleries"
 POL_fund_galleries_of_patriotic_art_desc:0 "It is possible to awaken mass consciousness with a new direction in art. A series of patriotic posters and the sponsorship of our artists will spur public sentiment. These works should inspire pride to us, and trembling to the enemies."
 
 POL_sikorski_wins:0 "Władysław Sikorski"
 POL_sikorski_wins_desc:0 "Although Sikorski didn't agree with Marshal in many cases, he has zeal, and most importantly talent. He is a diligent officer and a true patriot. Who, if not him, will be able to protect our Poland from the tornado of uncertainty that is now dragging the world?"
 POL_culture_not_race:0 "Culture, not Race"
 POL_culture_not_race_desc:0 "Poland is a multinational state. If we divide its citizens by race, we will not only deprive ourselves of human resources, but also sow distemper. Instead of simply expunging small nations from our lives, we will propose to the government a plan for their acculturation."
 POL_start_cultural_integration:0 "Cultural Integration"
 POL_start_cultural_integration_desc:0 "Replacing the culture of small nations with our culture is cruel, but if we want to preserve and strengthen the unity of the people, this act is justified. It is important that future generations will not regret this and they will accept reality as it will be."
 POL_partly_free_elections:0 "Limited Elections"
 POL_partly_free_elections_desc:0 "An unambiguous dictatorship is not the most prudent idea. Throughout our history, we have seen the actions and consequences of both full democracy and comprehensive diktat. We must balance our system so that we can hear the voice of ordinary people and at the same time not depend on them."
 POL_promote_political_activness:0 "Political Life of Society"
 POL_promote_political_activness_desc:0 "Some believe that the participation of the people in politics is a dangerous thing. On the one hand, this is true, but if we accompany public opinion and lure opposition activists, we will create the illusion of political competition and dilute the distrust of even the most ardent dissidents towards us."
 POL_freedom_of_religion:0 "Freedom of Religion"
 POL_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "In fact, our country rarely had problems with believers. This is what distinguishes us from other powers whose unity is based on religion, when we are united by the spirit of the people. That's why they call us the country without stakes — we have never executed for worshipping other gods and so it will continue."
 POL_equality_of_man_and_woman:0 "Equality of Man and Woman"
 POL_equality_of_man_and_woman_desc:0 "Not only men are capable of performing great feats. History knows a lot about women whose deeds surpassed men's fame.

 POL_allow_and_encourage_woman_in_military:0 "Women in the Military"
 POL_allow_and_encourage_woman_in_military_desc:0 "Polish women are free to work for the good of our country, but they cannot perform military service because of entrenched stereotypes and arrogant male power. To turn a blind eye to this means to deprive ourselves of new soldiers and officers, and we are not in a position to allow ourselves such a luxury."
 POL_establish_honor_i_ojczyzna:0 "Honour and Fatherland"
 POL_establish_honor_i_ojczyzna_desc:0 "Our officers, including generals and marshals, remain scattered and true to their personal beliefs. The organization Honour and Fatherland will be able to consolidate all military aspirations and interrupt disagreements in the ranks of the armed forces."
 POL_invite_ND_to_government:0 "Invite National Democracy"
 POL_invite_ND_to_government_desc:0 "National Democracy or Endecja is a right-wing nationalist party, whose slogans largely coincide with the vision of our Marshal. They are democratic enough to create the appearance of a fair system and not radical enough to put a spoke in the wheel."
 POL_emphasize_catholic_values:0 "Catholic Values"
 POL_emphasize_catholic_values_desc:0 "We tolerate any religion, but the majority of the population in our country are Catholics, and the government itself is pro-Catholic, so it would be logical to support the dominant role of Catholicism, which has accompanied Poland for many centuries."
 POL_encourage_priests_in_military:0 "Priests in the Military"
 POL_encourage_priests_in_military_desc:0 "The system of military chaplains of the Polish Military is currently in a deplorable state since the Great War because of the indifferent attitude of the Piłsudski system to it. Both the Endecja and the Catholic Church demand reform, and the positive thing is that the latter are ready to take on most of the costs we need to implement it."
 POL_religion_in_schools:0 "Religion in Schools"
 POL_religion_in_schools_desc:0 "Religious teaching has always been an unofficial part of our education system. Since the public school system is in a very deplorable state, the Catholic Church plays a significant role in its maintenance. Our allies from Endecja can help, but in return they ask for an official role for the church in the education system."
 POL_catholic_school_reform:0 "Catholic Education"
 POL_catholic_school_reform_desc:0 "After the last education reform, it became quite obvious that the Catholic Church has more influence than we thought. Now the church wants us to reform the current national curriculum and make Catholic education a mandatory part of the system."
 POL_invite_PSL_to_government:0 "Invite the People's Party"
 POL_invite_PSL_to_government_desc:0 "The People's Party is a merger of small agrarian parties, which advocates strengthening the positions of the peasantry in politics. By sharing government positions with them, we could use their resources to solve pressing problems."
 POL_increase_social_grants:0 "Social Grants"
 POL_increase_social_grants_desc:0 "Since the Great War, the social security and school education system has been in a terrible state.

 POL_nationalist_school_reform:0 "Nationalist School Reform"
 POL_nationalist_school_reform_desc:0 "The current national curriculum is a complete mess. The People's Party calls for immediate reform in order to reorganize the entire institution of education by introducing a new, more patriotic and progressive system."
 POL_increase_agrarian_founds:0 "Agrarian Founds"
 POL_increase_agrarian_founds_desc:0 "Objectively, the state of our rural areas is not at the level of Western European countries.

We need to introduce more profitable government loans available exclusively to farmers."
 POL_better_living_conditions_for_countryside:0 "New Rural Standards"
 POL_better_living_conditions_for_countryside_desc:0 "The biggest problem of rural areas is relatively low living conditions.

 POL_make_deal_with_king:0 "Deal with the King"
 POL_make_deal_with_king_desc:0 "Fryderyk Krystian II is not an obstacle to the Sanation government. We can use the young king for our purposes by handing him only nominal power. We will play monarchy as long as people like it."
 
 POL_stachniuk_wins:0 "Jan Stachniuk"
 POL_stachniuk_wins_desc:0 "Stachniuk is a neo-pagan with charm, influence and unusual ideas. He criticizes Christianity and capitalism, and also calls for a return to life in the traditions of the proto-Slavic society. Poland is closer to this ideology than it may seem at first glance, but to prove it, we need to remove the mask of Catholicism from our nation."
 POL_find_support_among_radicals:0 "Radical Support"
 POL_find_support_among_radicals_desc:0 "Some radicals consider our actions to be correct because of the economic program and attitude towards the Catholic Church. We could attract these Reds to work for the new Polish state, and not for a destructive revolution."
 POL_find_support_among_artists:0 "Artists Support"
 POL_find_support_among_artists_desc:0 "There are artists who support our cause, but now they remain unnoticed. But as soon as they find the recognition of the government, they will be able to compete with the current artists."
 
 POL_piasecki_wins:0 "Bolesław Piasecki"
 POL_piasecki_wins_desc:0 "Piasecki is a right-wing radical ideologue who advocates building a Catholic dictatorship in Poland. There is already an autocratic order in our country, and religion plays an important role in the life of society, therefore this idea does not seem so radical..."
 POL_seek_support_from_ND:0 "Endecjan Support"
 POL_seek_support_from_ND_desc:0 "Many members of the National Democracy share our views on the future of Poland.

 POL_seek_support_from_catholic_church:0 "Church Support"
 POL_seek_support_from_catholic_church_desc:0 "The Catholic Church is an important part of Poland and our main ideological pillar. We must win over the church, for example, by transferring a number of property in its favor."

 POL_purge_the_party_desc:0 "Although we have seized power, there are many adherents of the old policy with great influence and authority behind us. If they are not replaced by a new organization, we risk being in a political impasse."

We are honorably ready to take on this mission."
 POL_take_peoples_property_from_capitalists:0 "Nationalization of Foreign Property"
 POL_take_peoples_property_from_capitalists_desc:0 "The longer we allow foreign capitalists to enrich themselves on the Polish market, the weaker our state becomes. This must end! All the riches of Poland should belong only to its people."

 POL_propagation_of_proletarian_nationalism_desc:0 "Unlike the internationalists, we do not set as our goal a world revolution and the overthrow of the state. Poland and its workers are above all. This position should be conveyed both to our citizens and to our neighbors."

 POL_lechitic_legacy_desc:0 "Some say that the Great Lechitic Empire did not exist, but what really matters is that we can use this legend for propaganda purposes and to justify our actions on the world stage."

 POL_gloryfiy_mieslaws_uprising_desc:0 "The uprising of Miecław was a response to high taxes and the suppression of local beliefs by the Catholic Church during the reign of King Mieszko II.

 POL_torch_for_all_slavs:0 "The Torch for All Slavs"
 POL_torch_for_all_slavs_desc:0 "In one of his books, Jan Stachniuk created the concept of a «Supernation» — a nation of all Slavs, where initially all cultures are equal, but which eventually merge into one «Superculture» that will be superior to any other."
 POL_keep_friends_from_above_baltic:0 "Balto-Slavic Kinship"
 POL_keep_friends_from_above_baltic_desc:0 "In the ancient times of the migration of peoples, the Balts and Slavs were one group. Later, when they moved from nomadism to a sedentary lifestyle in Eastern Europe, they split up. Our government should focus on restoring its former unity."
 POL_remember_niklots_sacriface:0 "Perpetuate Niklot's Sacrifice"
 POL_remember_niklots_sacriface_desc:0 "Niklot was the last independent prince of the Obotrites, one of the Slavic tribes in what is now Germany.

 POL_return_of_ancient_faith_desc:0 "Finally, we have weakened the Catholic Church and liberated all the holy places of the Slavic faith! There is still a lot of work to do, but now we can help the peoples restore the beliefs of our common ancestors."
 POL_incorporate_beauty_of_east:0 "The Beauty of the East"
 POL_incorporate_beauty_of_east_desc:0 "Adam Mickiewicz praised the beauty of the East in many poems. These lands are truly worthy of becoming part of the great Slavia. However, first they need to be protected from those who encroach on the culture itself of our big people."

 POL_start_army_reform:0 "Military Reform"
 POL_start_army_reform_desc:0 "It's not that our army is weak, but years of waiting have made it obsolete, and the high command is more involved in politics than in the defense of the country. The Polish Military urgently needs to be put on its feet! The sooner we start reforming the armed forces, the better."
 
 POL_navy_reform:0 "Inspection in the Fleet"
 POL_navy_reform_desc:0 "It is necessary to monitor the implementation of the reform in the fleet. Selfish minds believe that if our Navy is small, then you can leave it to its fate. Difficult times are approaching, and now more than ever it is important to keep our ships ready."
 POL_great_fleet:0 "Great Fleet"
 POL_great_fleet_desc:0 "The truth is that the states that had a great fleet have always been successful and expanded their colonial possessions and trade relations, and in our times, a large fleet serves as an instrument of pressure even on the most remote countries. That is why there is no more compelling reason for Poland not to build a large fleet."
 POL_coast_defence:0 "Coastal Defense"
 POL_coast_defence_desc:0 "While working on improving the fleet, in parallel it is necessary to develop a plan to protect the coast in case of an enemy invasion. We will place strong points for our garrisons at key points of the coastline."

 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_surface:0 "Giants of the Baltic Sea"
 POL_upgrade_beasts_of_surface_desc:0 "The Polish Navy should have no equal in the Baltic! Each individual ship must represent a dangerous force. Such a ship should have all the means to combat aviation, surface and submarine fleets, as well as be able to fire at the enemy on land."
 POL_maritime_defence_fund:0 "Maritime Defence Fund"
 POL_maritime_defence_fund_desc:0 "The purpose of the Maritime Defence Fund is to expand the Polish Navy by raising funds among our citizens and Poles living abroad.

 POL_expand_river_flotillas_desc:0 "Our vast rivers allow them to be used not only in civil and commercial shipping, but also in military.

 POL_ListenToOrliczDreszer_has_not_DreszerDESC:0 "Taking control of a seaborne region is one thing, but landing on an enemy coast is quite another. It is required to take measures aimed at training the commanders and personnel of the Marine Corps. In addition, such people will be useful not only for amphibious assault, but also for forcing rivers and other difficult terrain."
 POL_plan_underwater_ORPs:0 "Submarine Armada"

In addition, the overall strength of the structure plays an important role."

 POL_build_dams:0 "Build Dams"
