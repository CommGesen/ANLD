 deluge_spain.1.t:0 "Death of our king!"
 deluge_spain.1.d:0 "Our great King Roland I died this morning. Over the past 10 years, his health continued to deteriorate until he finally passed away. He was an extraordinary man - an educated geographer. In England he studied university life, in the Netherlands river trade, in Sweden and Norway he was interested in the anthropology of the Lapland inhabitants and the fishing industry, and in Tyrol and Switzerland - hydrography. He also wrote works on history and collected a large collection of works on geography, history and other sciences. By the will of his will, his huge herbarium with approximately 2.5 million exhibits and 100,000 species will be made available in a public state museum. Roland had only one daughter, Maria - a psychoanalyst of the Freudian school. Shortly after her birth, her mother and the king's wife died, and he never remarried. For this reason, a dispute broke out in our country regarding the future of the state. Should Mary become queen or should we look for another solution? Conservatives and reactionaries believe that a woman should not be a monarch, while progressive monarchists believe the opposite. There are also those who want a different monarch, the most popular being Prince Sixtus née Bourbon-Parma from Portugal. There are also republicans who are taking advantage of the confusion to overthrow the monarchy.\n\nCrowning Mary would be the most stable option, we would still be dependent on Paris but safe. However, any other option may result in military intervention by France if it still has power over us. The crowning of Sixtus will end with our submission to Portugal, while many consider it better than being subject to France. We can also blackmail France that if they do not give us full sovereignty, Mary I will not become queen, but whether France will agree remains unknown. The decision will be taken at the next government meeting."
 deluge_spain.1.a:0 "The Republicans interrupt the government meeting, overthrow it and the monarchy along with it."
 deluge_spain.1.b:0 "We should ask the Portuguese dynasty if they will allow Prince Sixtus to be crowned."
 deluge_spain.1.c:0 "We should remain obedient to France."
 deluge_spain.1.e:0 "Let's try to negotiate our freedom."
 deluge_spain.2.t:0 "Spanish Monarchy Abolished!"
 deluge_spain.2.d:0 "After the recent death of King Roland I Bonaparte, great geographer and scientist, there was slight chaos in the country because no one knew what to do next. While the government was debating on this topic, the republicans interrupted the meeting, overthrew the government and the monarchy along with it, declaring a republic. Potential successor Marie Bonaparte disappeared."
 deluge_spain.2.a:0 "Good for them?"
 deluge_spain.3.t:0 "New King for Spain!"
 deluge_spain.3.d:0 "The Bourbon-Parma dynasty reached an agreement with the Spanish government, thanks to which Prince Sixtus of the house of Bourbon-Parma became the king of Spain following the recent death of Roland I Bonaparte and the denial of the coronation to Mary Bonaparte, the former king's daughter, by the Spanish government. The Bonaparte dynasty was very unhappy with this move of the Spanish government. This made Spain dependent on Portugal, but time will tell whether this will also guarantee security for the Spanish nation."
 deluge_spain.3.a:0 "Good for them?"
 deluge_spain.4.t:0 "New Queen of Spain!"
 deluge_spain.4.d:0 "After the recent death of the king and outstanding geographer Roland I Bonaparte in Spain, there was a debate whether to crown his daughter Maria Bonaparte, a psychonalyst of the Freudian school, or to look for an alternative solution. It was decided to crown her as Queen of Spain, the first queen since the 16th century. Spain is still a French dominion - part of the Bonaparte Empire. Time will tell whether this will keep the Spanish people safe."
 deluge_spain.4.a:0 "Good for them?"
 deluge_spain.5.t:0 "Spain abolished monarchy!"
 deluge_spain.5.d:0 "After the recent death of the king and outstanding geographer of Spain, Roland I of the Bonaparte dynasty, a debate broke out whether to crown Maria Bonaparte, Roland's only daughter, or to seek another solution. While the government was debating this issue, there was a coup that overthrew the government that was loyal to us, as well as the Spanish monarchy itself, which led to the creation of the republic. We can use this to intervene militarily to put Mary on the throne, but the question is whether it is worth doing? After 700 days from the start of the intervention, Spain will be able to force us to sign the White Peace if we do not capitulate."
 deluge_spain.5.a:0 "We are not strong enough to keep them in our sphere..."
 deluge_spain.5.b:0 "It's time to start a military intervention."
 deluge_spain.6.t:0 "France intervenes in Spain!"
 deluge_spain.6.d:0 "Following the recent overthrow of the Spanish monarchy loyal to the French House of Bonaparte, the Spanish Republic was established, independent of France. For this reason, France launched a special operation to restore the Bonapartes to the throne of Spain with Marie Bonaparte, Roland's only daughter, as queen. Time will tell who will win this war."
 deluge_spain.6.a:0 "Another war..."
 deluge_spain.7.t:0 "Proposal of the Spanish government..."
 deluge_spain.7.d:0 "Recently, the King of Spain and outstanding scientist Roland I Bonaparte died, and his successor should be Maria Bonaparte, his only daughter, while many Spanish conservatives and reactionaries cannot imagine a woman as a monarch. Therefore, the Spanish government approached us with a proposal to debark Prince Sixtus, which would make Spain dependent on us. If we agree and Spain is dependent on France, France may declare war on us. We need to consider whether it's worth it..."
 deluge_spain.7.a:0 "Reject the propsal."
 deluge_spain.7.b:0 "Accept the proposal."
 deluge_spain.8.t:0 "Rejection of Portugese government..."
 deluge_spain.8.d:0 "The Portuguese government rejected our proposal. What should we do?"
 deluge_spain.8.a:0 "Give up to republicans and abolish monarchy..."
 deluge_spain.8.b:0 "Crown Marie Bonaparte!"
 deluge_spain.8.c:0 "Try to negotiate with [FRA.GetName]..."
 deluge_spain.9.t:0 "Portugese government accepted!"
 deluge_spain.9.d:0 "The Portuguese government accepted our offer. Prince Sixtus will become our new king, and we will become dependent on Portugal but free from France."
 deluge_spain.9.a:0 "Yey!"
 deluge_spain.10.t:0 "Spain crowns Prince Sixtus!"
 deluge_spain.10.d:0 "After the recent death of the king and outstanding geographer of Spain, Roland I of the Bonaparte dynasty, a debate broke out whether to crown Maria Bonaparte, Roland's only daughter, or to seek another solution. The Spanish government, although theoretically dependent on us, announced in cooperation with Portugal that Prince Sixtus née Bourbon-Parma would become the new king of Spain, and not Maria Bonaparte. This will make Spain independent from us! We can use this to intervene militarily to put Mary on the throne, but the question is whether it is worth doing? After 700 days from the start of the intervention, Spain will be able to force us to sign the White Peace if we do not capitulate."
 deluge_spain.10.a:0 "We are not strong enough to keep them in our sphere..."
 deluge_spain.10.b:0 "It's time to start a military intervention."
 deluge_spain.11.t:0 "France intervenes in Spain!"
 deluge_spain.11.d:0 "After the crowning of the Portuguese prince Sixtus née Bourbon-Parma as Spanish king, the kingdom of Spain became independent from France. For this reason, France launched a special military operation aimed at placing Marie Bonaparte on the Spanish throne and restoring Spain's dependence on France."
 deluge_spain.11.a:0 "Another war..."
 deluge_spain.12.t:0 "Demands of the Spanish government..."
 deluge_spain.12.d:0 "After the death of Roland I of our house Bonaparte, the Spanish government is blackmailing us that if we do not give them full freedom, they will not crown Maria Bonaparte, the king's only daughter, as queen. Should we return this freedom to them or deny it, which may result in very unforeseen consequences?"
 deluge_spain.12.a:0 "Agree to their demands!"
 deluge_spain.12.b:0 "Reject their demands!"
 deluge_spain.13.t:0 "France accepted!"
 deluge_spain.13.d:0 "France agreed to our demands and we became a fully free country, with Maria Bonaparte as our queen."
 deluge_spain.13.a:0 "Yey!"
 deluge_spain.14.t:0 "New Queen of Spain!"
 deluge_spain.14.d:0 "After the recent death of the king and outstanding geographer Roland I Bonaparte in Spain, there was a debate whether to crown his daughter Maria Bonaparte, a psychonalyst of the Freudian school, or to look for an alternative solution. It was decided to crown her as Queen of Spain, the first queen since the 16th century. Spain, thanks to negotiations with France, became a free state thanks to the coronation of Mary. Time will tell whether this was a good solution to the problems of Spanish succession."
 deluge_spain.14.a:0 "Interesting..."
 deluge_spain.15.t:0 "France rejected our demands!"
 deluge_spain.15.d:0 "France rejected our demand, so we will not be able to gain freedom through the coronation of Marie Bonaparte. So what should we do?"
 deluge_spain.15.a:0 "Give up to republicans and abolish monarchy..."
 deluge_spain.15.b:0 "Crown Marie Bonaparte."
 deluge_spain.15.c:0 "We should ask the Portuguese dynasty if they will allow Prince Sixtus to be crowned."
 deluge_spain.16.t:0 "Our only options..."
 deluge_spain.16.d:0 "Both the Bourbon-Parma dynasty and the French Bonapartes rejected our demands. What should we do?"
 deluge_spain.16.a:0 "Give up to republicans and abolish monarchy..."
 deluge_spain.16.b:0 "Crown Marie Bonaparte."
 deluge_spain.17.t:0 "New King for Spain!"
 deluge_spain.17.d:0 "The Bourbon-Parma dynasty reached an agreement with the Spanish government, thanks to which Prince Sixtus of the house of Bourbon-Parma became the king of Spain following the recent death of Roland I Bonaparte and the denial of the coronation to Mary Bonaparte, the former king's daughter, by the Spanish government. The Bonaparte dynasty was very unhappy with this move of the Spanish government. Due to the fact that the Bourbon-Parma dynasty does not rule an independent Portugal as it did before, Spain can enjoy freedom."
 deluge_spain.17.a:0 "Good for them?"
 deluge_spain.18.t:0 "Victory?"
 deluge_spain.18.d:0 "We held out long enough to force France to sign a peace treaty. Do we want to do this?"
 deluge_spain.18.a:0 "Yes"
 deluge_spain.18.b:0 "No"
 deluge_spain.19.t:0 "Peace between France and Spain!"
 deluge_spain.19.d:0 "After long fighting between Spain and France, the governments of these two countries came to an agreement that further fighting was pointless. Both countries signed the White Peace, Spain is fully independent from France, thanks to which this war can be called the third Spanish war of independence and the first one that ended successfully for the Spanish nation."
 deluge_spain.19.a:0 "Peace at last!"
 deluge_spain.20.t:0 "Marie Bonaparte installed on Spanish throne!"
 deluge_spain.20.d:0 "After the final enslavement of Spain by the French Empire, the government of France crowned Marie Bonparte as María I - the first Queen of Spain since the 16th century. Spain is a dependent kingdom of France, where the government only follows the orders of Paris and the queen is only a figurehead."
 deluge_spain.20.a:0 "Poor Spain..."
