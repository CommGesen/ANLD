 deluge_switching_ideologies.1.d:0 "Democratic moods in our country have been growing for some time. The Democrats infiltrated our government and forced it to accept the result of the referendum, the results of which could only be one - the creation of a new, fully democratic government elected by the people."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.1.a:0 "The people were heard."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.2.t:0 "National Referendum"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.2.d:0 "Nationalism has been on the rise in our country for some time. The previous government failed to look after the interests of our people adequately and effectively. Nationalist politicians infiltrated the government and enabled a referendum to be held, which led to the creation of a new, national government that put the good of the nation above all. The time of the non-nation state is over."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.2.a:0 "Our country will be great."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.3.t:0 "National Referendum"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.3.d:0 "Radical ideologies have long been gaining popularity in our country. At first the revolutionaries shouted in the streets, now they shout from government lecterns. They forced the former government to hold a referendum, which created a new people's government that cared primarily about the working people. The exploitation of people in our country has ended."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.3.a:0 "People's evolution success!"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.4.t:0 "National Referendum"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.4.d:0 "Monarchist sentiments have been growing in our country for a long time. Our citizens were fed up with incompetent governments, corrupt politicians fighting among themselves for power, and crises every time the government fell. The people believe that we need an outstanding, enlightened individual who can lead us. We need a monarch.\n\nMonarchists took over many positions in the government and led to a referendum on the introduction of a monarchy. The nation was in favor and a new government was formed, obedient to the newly crowned monarch."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.4.a:0 "Let the monarch save us!"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.5.t:0 "Democrats in power in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.5.d:0 "The democratic opposition in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName], after a long period of rebellions and demonstrations, overthrew the dictatorship and introduced democracy. The first elections were held, which were won by the [FROM.GetDemocraticParty] led by [FROM.GetDemocraticLeader]. The new government is planning many reforms aimed at liberalizing and democratizing social life and privatizing state property. It is not yet known how this will affect politics in the region, but it is expected that there will be fewer armed conflicts."
 deluge_switching_ideologies.5.a:0 "Good for them?"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.6.t:0 "Radicals in power in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.6.d:0 "The proletariat in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] had long been oppressed and lived in poverty barely scraping by. After a long period of revolts and demonstrations, the radical coalition established a people's republic. [FROM.GetCommunistParty], led by [FROM.GetCommunistLeader], dominated the coalition and became the main ruling party. The current government is already planning many agricultural and labor reforms, as well as many nationalizations and collectivizations of private property. It is not yet known how this will affect politics in the region, but it is expected that more armed conflicts will be led by the workers' revolution."

 deluge_switching_ideologies.7.t:0 "Nationalists in power in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.7.d:0 "Many [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] citizens have long felt that their needs are not met, their requests are not heard, and the government is guided by cosmopolitanism, introducing foreign trends, traditions and words to the [FROM.GetAdjectiveCap] country. For this reason, a national coalition was formed, consisting of many nationalist parties with the goal of creating a nation state. Today, this has happened. The national coalition forced the resignation of the current government and formed a government where [FROM.GetFascistParty], led by [FROM.GetFascistLeader], dominates. The current government plans to assimilate minorities, as well as introduce patriotic traditions into everyday life. A significant increase in imperialism and conflicts caused by it is expected in this region."

 deluge_switching_ideologies.8.t:0 "New Monarch of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
 deluge_switching_ideologies.8.d:0 "Reactionaries and conservatives began to gain popularity in [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] some time ago. Believing that the current government was not able to lead the country towards a bright future, they trusted [FROM.GetNeutralLeader] and forced the previous government to resign, and the new one crowned [FROM.GetNeutralLeader] as the monarch of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]. It is not yet certain what reforms the new despot is planning, but they will probably be beneficial primarily to the ruler's close circle. It is not yet known what the foreign policy of the new despot will look like, but the Minister of Foreign Affairs has already been appointed. Generally speaking - the fate of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName] is unknown."
