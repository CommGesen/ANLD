 POL_deluge_jozef_pilsudski_name:0 "Józef Piłsudski"
 POL_deluge_jozef_pilsudski_desc:0 "Was born on December 5, 1867.\n\nWhen the Great War began, Józef Piłsudski was already a marshal and commanded armies at the front in Westphalia, where he met Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Despite their efforts, the war was lost. Józef Piłsudski was depressed, he began to doubt the existence of God. In the following time, up to 1930, he watched the decline of his country due to the reparations and restrictions imposed on the state, as well as due to the ineffective rule of the coalition of left-wing parties. At that time, he preached revanchist slogans.\n\nIn 1930, as a high-ranking commander and veteran, he imposed a state of emergency with the assistance of far-right and monarchist politicians, as well as loyal soldiers. He established a program of «moral rehabilitation» of the society — Sanation. His rule was of a center-right, conservative and paternalistic nature. He inculcated atheism, created many places of exile for his political opponents, began to militarize Polish society and installed many means of surveillance.\n\nCurrently, Piłsudski is trying to actively participate in Polish politics, in which he enjoys extraordinary popularity, despite the fact that his health is inevitably deteriorating."
 POL_deluge_sanation_emergency_council_name:0 "Sanation Emergency Council"
 POL_deluge_sanation_emergency_council_desc:0 "The Marshal's chair is empty. The group of generals and politicians of the Sanation government, who are called upon to overcome the current crisis, seems to only exacerbate it on the contrary, and the longer the power vacuum continues to exist, the sooner Poland plunges into uncertainty."
 POL_deluge_edward_rydz_smigly_name:0 "Edward Rydz-Śmigły"
 POL_deluge_edward_rydz_smigly_desc:0 "Was born on March 11, 1886.\n\nIn 1908, Edward Rydz-Śmigły decided to build his career in state service. For this reason, he interrupted his studies at the Art Academy and entered the Military Academy in Warsaw, from which he graduated with honors in 1912. While studying in Warsaw, he met Józef Piłsudski and gradually became imbued with his views, he also became interested in aviation and became a pilot. This led to his awareness of the importance of war in the air. At the beginning of the Great War, he was promoted to marshal and served with Józef Piłsudski on the Westphalian front. His orders and the actions resulting from them were considered aggressive and even cruel. After the war, he was crushed by the weight of defeat. He joined the activities of Piłsudski, who promoted nationalism and revanchism.\n\nIn 1925, after the entry into force of the law allowing the surname to be supplemented with a pseudonym adopted during military service, Edward Rydz, who had also used the pseudonym Śmigły since 1923, changed his name to Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Over time, he became more radical than Piłsudski himself, and yet he claims that he will rule only when his country needs it."
 POL_deluge_wladyslaw_sikorski_name:0 "Władysław Sikorski"
 POL_deluge_wladyslaw_sikorski_desc:0 "Was born on May 20, 1881.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Great War, Władysław Sikorski received an officer's diploma at a military school and became a second lieutenant in the Polish Military reserve. In 1907, he became close to the Polish Socialist Party. At this time, he met Józef Piłsudski. Having a solid military education, Sikorski trained other party members, introducing them to issues related to the art of war. He was one of the co-founders and members of the Polish anti-monarchist organizations of the time of George I: the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Union. By the time of the Great War, Sikorski had become a marshal, he served at the front in Austria, where soldiers respected him for taking care of human resources and thoughtful actions aimed at solving situations as bloodlessly as possible.\n\nAfter the end of the war, he was devastated by this loss of defeat and believed that it was partly his fault. Sikorsky believes in democratic and libertarian ideals, but the defeat in the Great War forced him to take a more revanchist and nationalist position. In 1930, despite serious ideological contradictions with Józef Piłsudski, he managed to gain great power in the Sanation government."
 POL_deluge_jan_stachniuk_name:0 "Jan Stachniuk"
 POL_deluge_jan_stachniuk_desc:0 "Was born on January 13, 1905.\n\nIn 1933, Jan Stachniuk began to enter the circles of Sanation. At the same time, he published his first the Collectivism and the nation book, which combines nationalism and collectivism, and two years later the Heroic community of nation book — he outlined the concept of zadrugism in it, the purpose of which is «to direct all spheres of human activity to the development of the individual and the nation». The very name Zadruga comes from the term denoting the Ancient Slavic tribal community. He is also the author of the History without history book, which presents an analysis of the causes of the historical decline of Poland, in which Stachniuk blamed Catholicism and the Jesuit counter-reformation in Poland. He became a theorist of nationalist and at the same time anti-capitalist ideology, which rejects Christianity because of its destructive influence on the national character, partly because of its foreign, namely Jewish, origin, and calls for the creation of a collective society — «National creating community».\n\nIn 1935, he moved to Warsaw with Sabina Różycka, his then life companion. In the same year, he founded the Zadruga magazine, which he published until he became the leader of the state. The magazine is currently run by his wife."
 POL_deluge_boleslaw_piasecki_name:0 "Bolesław Piasecki"
 POL_deluge_boleslaw_piasecki_desc:0 "Was born on February 18, 1915.\n\nDuring his school years, Bolesław Piasecki actively participated in the scout movement, where he served as an assistant and then as an adjutant. In May 1931, he passed his final exams, and in 1935 graduated from law studies of the University of Warsaw. During his studies, he headed the academic department of the Camp of Great Poland and was an active member of the youth section of the National Party. Since 1932, he belongs to the National Radical Camp, but after a party split, he became the leader of the Falanga national radical movement, which preached anti-radical and anti-Semitic views. Piasecki's party of that time could compete for the title of the most ultranationalist.\n\nPiasecki bitterly endured the collapse of the NRC, but he also saw it as an opportunity. After he openly supported the activities of Józef Piłsudski in 1930, he won the respect of many, including officials, thanks to whom he managed to create a network of government contacts, which made him one of the most important members of Sanation by 1935."
 POL_deluge_roman_dmowski_name:0 "Roman Dmowski"
 POL_deluge_roman_dmowski_desc:0 "Was born on August 9, 1864.\n\nThe hero of the democratic opposition, who opposes the Wettyn autocratic monarchy, Roman Dmowski comes from a family of petty bourgeois. During his school years, he was an ardent opponent of loyalty to the Wettyn regime. After graduating with excellent grades, he became the leader of the National Democracy and an assertive member of the democratic opposition. He was imprisoned for his activities, but fled to Constantinople, where he joined the Carograd Clique — the Polish opposition milieu in Turkey, and while in Paris he actively opposed the order in the eastern states controlled by the French Empire.\n\nAfter the death of King George I, he returned to his homeland, participated in the elections for the first time, but lost them. The victorious coalition of Socialists failed to cope with the post-war hardships, which provoked Piłsudski to establish a dictatorship. Many supporters of Dmovsky have defected to the side of Sanation, and he himself began to be persecuted for his beliefs since then. In an era of new opportunities, Dmowski is ready to stand up against autocracy and lead Poland on the path to prosperity."

 POL_deluge_walery_slawek_desc:0 "Was born on November 2, 1879.\n\nAfter the Great War, Walery Sławek suffered and became depressed for a long time because of his wounds and the humiliation of Poland caused by the Treaty of Versailles. He remained interested in politics, but did not take an active part in it until mid-1927. But when he returned to politics, he sharply criticized the then government of the PSP and PPP coalition.\n\nDespite his close relationship with Piłsudski, the May 1930 coup came as a surprise to Sławek. He joined the action only in the spring of 1930. And although he was in the Marshal's inner circle, he did not take part in military operations. After Sanation came to power, he returned to active service, despite his limited participation in the coup, he was promoted to general. During the reign of Sanation, he established contacts with both monarchical and national radical circles. He managed to become Piłsudski's right-hand man when his main rival, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, began to be called his left hand. In 1934, he was promoted to marshal.\n\nDespite the internal contradictions between the idealism of Thomas More and the cruelty of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sławek is confident that the iron fist of power must restore order in the future, and Poland's defeat must be avenged."
 POL_deluge_maciej_rataj_name:0 "Maciej Rataj"
 POL_deluge_maciej_rataj_desc:0 "Was born on February 19, 1884.\n\nIn 1914, Maciej Rataj joined the Polish People's Party. Five years later, he moved to Zamość, where was founded the Gazeta Zamojska party newspaper on his initiative. At that time, the PPP structures in the Zamość vicinity were not developed — the influence of the Polish Military Organization was great there. Therefore, in 1918, Rataj began to strengthen the support of his party in the rest of Lublin Voivodeship. He had become one of the most active social democratic activists in the region by that time. In 1918, he organized a major demonstration in support of the agrarian movement and a number of other events.\n\nAfter the 1925 elections, Rataj became a deputy of the Sejm. On December 1 of the same year, he was elected speaker — the centrist and right wing of the PPP voted for him. This role was extremely difficult and responsible due to the large party split in the chamber at that time. In a relatively short time, Rataj proved himself to be an effective organizer of the work of the Sejm, gaining the almost universal respect of the members of the chamber. On March 26, 1928, he completed his work as Marshal of the Sejm. After the May coup, his assessment of the new government deteriorated to such an extent that he soon became one of the main critics of the government. He called for a fight against the dictatorship, but using parliamentary democratic methods. In the end, he had to flee to Constantinople, where Rataj became part of the opposition Carograd Clique."
