Despite their efforts, the war was lost. Józef Piłsudski was depressed, he began to doubt the existence of God. In the following time, up to 1930, he watched the decline of his country due to the reparations and restrictions imposed on the state, as well as due to the ineffective rule of the coalition of left-wing parties. At that time, he preached revanchist slogans.\n\nIn 1930, as a high-ranking commander and veteran, he imposed a state of emergency with the assistance of far-right and monarchist politicians, as well as loyal soldiers. He established a program of «moral rehabilitation» of the society — Sanation. His rule was of a center-right, conservative and paternalistic nature. He inculcated atheism, created many places of exile for his political opponents, began to militarize Polish society and installed many means of surveillance.\n\nCurrently, Piłsudski is trying to actively participate in Polish politics, in which he enjoys extraordinary popularity, despite the fact that his health is inevitably deteriorating."

The group of generals and politicians of the Sanation government, who are called upon to overcome the current crisis, seems to only exacerbate it on the contrary, and the longer the power vacuum continues to exist, the sooner Poland plunges into uncertainty."

For this reason, he interrupted his studies at the Art Academy and entered the Military Academy in Warsaw, from which he graduated with honors in 1912. While studying in Warsaw, he met Józef Piłsudski and gradually became imbued with his views, he also became interested in aviation and became a pilot. This led to his awareness of the importance of war in the air. At the beginning of the Great War, he was promoted to marshal and served with Józef Piłsudski on the Westphalian front. His orders and the actions resulting from them were considered aggressive and even cruel. After the war, he was crushed by the weight of defeat. He joined the activities of Piłsudski, who promoted nationalism and revanchism.\n\nIn 1925, after the entry into force of the law allowing the surname to be supplemented with a pseudonym adopted during military service, Edward Rydz, who had also used the pseudonym Śmigły since 1923, changed his name to Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Over time, he became more radical than Piłsudski himself, and yet he claims that he will rule only when his country needs it."

He was one of the co-founders and members of the Polish anti-monarchist organizations of the time of George I: the Union of Active Struggle and the Riflemen's Union. By the time of the Great War, Sikorski had become a marshal, he served at the front in Austria, where soldiers respected him for taking care of human resources and thoughtful actions aimed at solving situations as bloodlessly as possible.\n\nAfter the end of the war, he was devastated by this loss of defeat and believed that it was partly his fault. Sikorsky believes in democratic and libertarian ideals, but the defeat in the Great War forced him to take a more revanchist and nationalist position. In 1930, despite serious ideological contradictions with Józef Piłsudski, he managed to gain great power in the Sanation government."

The very name Zadruga comes from the term denoting the Ancient Slavic tribal community. He is also the author of the History without history book, which presents an analysis of the causes of the historical decline of Poland, in which Stachniuk blamed Catholicism and the Jesuit counter-reformation in Poland. He became a theorist of nationalist and at the same time anti-capitalist ideology, which rejects Christianity because of its destructive influence on the national character, partly because of its foreign, namely Jewish, origin, and calls for the creation of a collective society — «National creating community».\n\nIn 1935, he moved to Warsaw with Sabina Różycka, his then life companion.

He was imprisoned for his activities, but fled to Constantinople, where he joined the Carograd Clique — the Polish opposition milieu in Turkey, and while in Paris he actively opposed the order in the eastern states controlled by the French Empire.\n\nAfter the death of King George I, he returned to his homeland, participated in the elections for the first time, but lost them. The victorious coalition of Socialists failed to cope with the post-war hardships, which provoked Piłsudski to establish a dictatorship. Many supporters of Dmowski have defected to the side of Sanation, and he himself began to be persecuted for his beliefs since then. In an era of new opportunities, Dmowski is ready to stand up against autocracy and lead Poland on the path to prosperity."

For this reason, he moved to Poznań. There, in October 1903, he began studying at the classical gymnasium.

In 1918, he organized a major demonstration in support of the agrarian movement and a number of other events.\n\nAfter the 1925 elections, Rataj became a deputy of the Sejm.

During the war, he joined the secret Polish Military Organization. Due to his poor health, he withdrew from all activities and went to Zakopane to improve his health. He also started law studies at the Jagiellonian University, which he did not complete. On June 1, 1923, he decided to adopt the Roman Catholic religion. He also started using the name Floyar-Rajchman. On November 14, 1924, he was assigned to the Military Academy in Warsaw as a student of the regular course.\n\nAt the time of the May coup, he served as a liaison between the forces of Piłsudski and the government. After Piłsudski's victory, he was transferred from the Command of Corps District No. I in Warsaw to the Office of Inspection of the Inspector General of the Armed Forces in Warsaw. On February 18, 1931, the Marshal awarded him the rank of major in the infantry officer corps. Due to the growing nationalist, revanchist and anti-German sentiments, the rest of the Sanation government and part of the population forced him to change his surname by removing the part "Rajchman", which is associated with the German Reich, and also to change "Floyar" to "Flojar" so that the writing reflected the way of reading - reading "y" as "j" does not occur naturally in Polish. Flojar was among Józef Piłsudski's associates who prepared a plan to carry out a "punitive action" against the leaders of National Democracy. Moreover, he became part of the so-called Koc-group, which integrated the environment of Piłsudski's collaborators, originating from the Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organization. He became close to the "Honor i Ojczyzna" organization, which operated secretly in the Polish Army and was linked to Władysław Sikorski.\n\nOn August 20, 1932, he was appointed military attaché at the Polish Legation in Tokyo. The scope of his competences extended not only to Japan, but also to China, Manchuria and Korea. His position in Japan increased when he became dean of the military and naval attaché corps at the imperial court. He served as the Polish military and naval attaché until 1935, and then returned to Poland, where he was placed inactive.\n\nAfter finishing his service in the army, he worked within the Ministry of Treasury on issues related to the organization of state-owned enterprises, and also worked on improving financial relations within private industrial enterprises. He later joined the Ministry of Industry and Trade, where on December 5, 1935, he became deputy minister and head of the Inspection Bureau. Shortly thereafter, he became Minister of Industry and Trade. He maintains very good relations with Leon Kozłowski."

As a result, he received a degree in mathematics. In 1933, he defended his doctoral thesis. Already during his studies, he became an important figure in the very prosperous community of Lwów mathematicians.\n\nThanks to a government subsidy to the University of Lwów, Ulam began working on nuclear research."

 POL_deluge_roja_desc:0 "He was born on April 4, 1876 in Bryniec Zagórne in the family of Józef, a farmer-forester, and Maria née Trzcińska. He was the half-brother of Wacław Mikołaj (born 1871). He was active in the secret anti-monarchist movement in Galicia. He attended high school in Lviv, and passed his high school final exams at St. Anna in Krakow. In the years 1895–1898 he studied at the Infantry Cadet School in Kraków. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1899. Due to poor health, in 1905 he was transferred to the reserve. He worked as a clerk in Krakow and studied law and medicine at the Jagiellonian University.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Great War, he joined the Polish Legions, in which he was a close associate of Józef Piłsudski. After the Battle of Frankfurt (Oder) in 1920, in which Roja was the commander of the 4th Infantry Regiment, there was a sharp exchange of words between them. Piłsudski assessed that Roja's actions were characterized by excessive bravado. In turn, Roja accused Piłsudski of being slow to attack, which meant that the companies were exposed to flank fire from the German-French troops.\n\nFrom January to August 1921, he commanded the 2nd Infantry Division of the Legions and the operational group on the Austrian Peninsula. In August 1922, he became the commander of the General District "Kielce", and in March 1923 the commander of the General District "Pomorze", where he first established the Pomeranian Council (a society aimed at protecting the Polishness of Pomerania). On April 21, 1923, he was confirmed in the rank of lieutenant general in the group of officers of the former Polish Legions.\n\nAt the end, he proposed locking himself in Ostrołęka in order to organize Zbaraż for the Germans, criticizing the General Staff in his reports for giving him tasks that were impossible to perform. Later, he was skeptical about Poland's chances of victory in the war with France, he had his own political and military visions, and for this reason he was called the red general (he often referred to socialist ideas in his appeals to soldiers). He was suspected of intending to declare the independence of Pomerania if the war ended in failure or to join it if such a situation occurred, but the second option came and Roja remained in Poland. After the Great War, he proposed to the king that he remove Piłsudski as a military ignoramus and announce the creation of a people's and workers' government based on socialist slogans, with the king as a constitutional monarch and Roja as commander of the armed forces, which would be aimed at solving the problem of radicals. The king did not accept this offer, but he informed the general's superiors about the matter. As a result, due to politicking and spreading defeatism, Roja was removed from command by Piłsudski in August 1920.\n\nIn 1925, he was elected to the Sejm of the Republic of Poland on behalf of the radical people's party - Peasant Party, and served as vice-chairman of the parliamentary Military Commission. In August 1931, he criticized Piłsudski in an open letter sent on the occasion of the Legionnaires' congress - the letter was confiscated by the censorship. Roja strongly criticized Piłsudski and Sanacja. An attempt to speak at one of the next Legionnaires' congresses in 1933 in Krakow ended with the general's internment in the psychiatric ward of a military hospital. After the overthrow of the Sanation, it was ruled that the diagnosis of mental illness was groundless and he was released and returned to military service."
