 POL_Pilsudski_leader_desc:0 "Józef Piłsudski of the Piłsudski coat of arms was born on December 5, 1867 in Zułów in the Vilnius region, which is located in Belarus, in a family with Polish patriotic traditions. Father, Józef Wincenty, was an important state official, mother - Maria née Billewicz - came from a well-known noble family of the Mogiła coat of arms. His parents moved to Poland when he was young, to Białystok in Podlasie.\n\nA year after his mother died, he graduated from Warsaw University (1885), where he was active in socialist and nationalist organizations against the monarchy. After graduation, he joined the army. On March 22, 1887, he was arrested for activities against the king, but he was released a year and a half later. In 1899, Piłsudski married Maria Juszkiewicz née Koplewska, an activist of the Polish Socialist Party, called "Beautiful Lady" by party members. After the old King Jerzy I died, the oppression slowly faded away, so Piłsudski focused on a military career and began to advocate more nationalist slogans.\n\nWhen the Great War broke out, he was already promoted to the rank of Marshal and commanded the armies on the front with Westphalia, where he got to know Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Despite his and Śmigły's efforts, the war was lost. Józef Piłsudski was devastated. He started to doubt existance of God. Over the following years, until 1930, he watched his country collapse due to ineffective socialist rule (PSL-PPS coalition) and the effects of the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, he preached revanchist slogans.\n\nIn 1930, as a high-ranking soldier, marshal and symbol of revenge, he introduced a state of emergency with the help of extreme right-wing and monarchist politicians, as well as loyal soldiers. From that moment, he introduced the program of "Sanation" of society, which mean healing it from all vices. His rule was a combination of totalitarianism, nationalism and socialism. He forced atheism, cult of personality, set up many labor camps for his political opponents, started to militarize Polish society and established many surveillance tools.

The parents got married in 1888, which was only 2 years after their son's birth, and the reason for this delay was probably financial problems overcome after his father's promotion to platoon sergeant. The Rydz family comes from the impoverished nobility or from the peasantry. Edward himself never spoke on the matter. Tomasz Rydz died when Edward was 2 years old, and his mother died when the boy was 10 years old. He was taken care of by his grandfather, Jan Babiak (who was a poor man who worked as a laborer in a slaughterhouse). A little later, the Uranowicz family, an intelligentsia family, took care of the child. Thanks to their support, Edward was able to go to school.He attended the Higher Gymnasium in Brzeżany, where he graduated in 1905 as Edward Rydz. During this time he became interested in social and political thought. He received, among others, the writings of Wincenty Lutosławski and Bolesław Limanowski. He was also known as a talented draftsman, sketching mainly landscapes. At the end of his secondary school education, he joined the socialist youth organization "Promień". He later found himself in "Rebirth". It was an organization that under King George I was anti-monarchist, then when Frederick I took power changed direction to nationalism.After graduating from high school and passing his final exams, he began his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow. In 1908, he decided to devote his artistic career to political and military activities. For this reason, he interrupted his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and moved to the Military Academy in Warsaw. In 1912 he graduated from this academy with honors. In 1913 he returned to his interrupted studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, which he graduated a year later. While studying at the Academy in Warsaw, he became acquainted with Józef Piłsudski and slowly absorbed his views.

In 1927, he passed his final exams at the Middle School names of Juliusz Słowacki in Kovel and began his studies at the Poznań School of Economics. During his studies, he was active in the Union of Polish Democratic Youth, Bratnia Pomoc WSH and was a member of "Zet". In 1930 he graduated from the Higher School of Commerce in Poznań. In the same year, he supported Józef Piłsudski's activities in Polish politics. After graduation, he worked for a short time at the Health Fund in Tuchola and then served in the military in Tomaszów Lubelski. He returned to Poznań, where in the period from December 1931 to May 1932 he was the editor of the responsible organ of ZPMD in Poznań - "Życie Uniwersyteckie". In 1932, he resigned from the "Zet" membership.\n\nIn 1933, he began to enter the Sanacja circles more and more, and also published his first book "Collectivism and The Nation", combining nationalist ideas with collectivism, and two years later, the "Heroic Community of the Nation". In it, he included his vision of the Zadruga system ("zadrugism"), the aim of which is "to direct all areas of human activity to personal and national development." The name "Zadruga" came from the term of an old Slavic tribal community. He was also the author of the book "History Without History", which was an analysis of the causes of Poland's historical decline, for which he blamed Catholicism and the Jesuit Counter-Reformation in Poland. He created a nationalist and at the same time anti-capitalist ideology, which rejected Christianity because of its destructive influence on the national character, partly due to foreign (Jewish) origin, and called for the creation of a collective society - the "National Creating Community".\n\nIn 1935 he moved to Warsaw with Sabina Różycka, his then life companion. In the same year, he founded the magazine "Zadruga", which he published until he became the leader of the state, currently his wife is in charge of the magazine."

His party and the views of Bolesław Piasecki at that time are sometimes described as overtly ultra-nationalist.\n\nHe was saddened when the party he belonged to fell apart. But he also saw an opportunity in it. After he openly supported the activities of Józef Piłsudski in 1930, he won the respect of many people, including officials, thanks to whom he managed to create a network of contacts, thanks to which in 1935 he was one of the most important members of Sanation."

 POL_deluge_rataj_desc:0 "He was born on February 19, 1884 in Chłopy. He was born into a poor farming family in the village of Chłopy near Lwów as the son of Wojciech and Józefa. His father was a man who appreciated the need to educate his son. In Chłopy, Maciej Rataj completed a one-grade folk school, and then a four-grade school in Komarno. For some time he stayed in Uście Solne. Later, he moved to Lwów, where he studied at the 4th Gymnasium and there in June 1904 he passed his final exams with distinction. Already at that time, he collaborated with the magazine "Przyjaciel Ludu". It was then that he decided to study classical philology at the University of Lviv. During his studies, he conducted educational and political activities in peasant circles. He was active in the Society of the People's School of Tadeusz Kościuszko and Brotherly Help. At the end of his education at the University of Lviv, he became a member of the Representative Committee of the Union of Progressive Youth. He graduated in 1908, after which he became a gymnasium teacher. From 1908 to 1918 he taught Latin at the VI Junior High School in Lviv. In 1918, he became a teacher at the gymnasium in Zamość. At that time, he found himself in the environment associated with "Kurier Lwowski". At that time, he met and collaborated with the activists of the Polish People's Party. In 1909 he married Bolesława Wiczyńska. The difficult financial situation soon forced him to accept a job offer as a private tutor. In 1913, there was a split in the peasant movement, and Maciej Rataj joined the PSL in 1914. Five years later he came to Zamość, where he became a classical philology teacher at a local school. On his initiative, "Gazeta Zamojska" was founded there. PSL structures were not developed in the vicinity of Zamość at that time. However, the Polish Military Organization (POW) was strong. So in 1918 Rataj began to build PSL support in the southern Lublin region. At that time, he was one of the most active social democratic activists in the region. In 1918 he organized a large pro-agrarian demonstration and some other events.\n\nAfter the elections in 1925, Rataj entered the Sejm (1st term). At the second sitting, on December 1, he was elected Speaker of the Sejm. He was voted for by the centrist and right-wing parties of the PSL party. This function was extremely difficult and responsible at that time due to the large party split in the chamber. In a relatively short time, Maciej Rataj turned out to be an efficient organizer of the work of the Sejm, earning him the universal respect of the majority of the members of the chamber. On March 26, 1928, he ended his activity as the Marshal of the Sejm. His successor was Ignacy Daszyński. Since the May coup, his assessment of the marshal had gradually deteriorated. He soon became one of the main critics of the Sanation government. He called for the fight against Sanation, but with the use of parliamentary democratic methods. He counted on the possibility of an agreement with Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski and Edward Śmigły-Rydz, but nothing came of it in recent years. He needed to escape to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, he became part of "Carograd Clique"."

After taking some painkillers he went to sleep on his sofa and never woke up. The cause of death is probably lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes, but today experts are also considering heart attack. Now the country is ruled by a group of politicians and officers that try to choose a new leader. However now when the country is in chaos there is opportunity for the opposition to do something.

This for many suprise, because he points out that Judeo-Christianity is the main enemy of Poland and Poles should come back to their roots. He also isn’t a soldier so it's the end of the military regime in Poland. For sure he will bring wind of very big changes for Poland, but only time will tell about their effectiveness."

However he never talks about his economic programs. Before the Marshal's coup in 1930 he was connected with ONR-Falanga. Because of this many people think that Sanation’s days come to an end and the ONR-Falanga will be a new party. Also he is not a soldier and he still gets chosen as a new leader, which ends the military regime in Poland. Time will tell what comes out of this."

The leader of this monarchist coalition is Aleks Ćwiakowski, proposed a temporary alliance to the ND-PSL coalition, in exchange for keeping the king in power.

 deluge_poland.78.d:0 "Adam Mickiewicz is Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian national poet. While he was young Napoleon with his Grand Army and Józef Poniatowski were marching to Russia through his village in Lithuania. He studied in Vilnius. Later when new order in Eastern Europe was established he dissatisfied and opposed to it. It diveded Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into Ukraine, Belarus, Baltic Duchy and Poland. He thought that dividing Poland and Lithuania at that moment was bad decision, because many people thought about themselves as Polish-Lithuanians. There were many mixed families, especially in the east of the country. Many people in Lithuania still spoke Polish. He didn't think the same about Ukraine and Belarus, he pointed only that their national identity were not fully developed. He also thought that Baltic Duchy is not fully stable country, because it combined Lithuania, which at that time was closer to Poland, with Lativa, which at that time was influenced by German, Russian and Lithuania cultures, and Estonia which was closer to Northern Europe. He wanted restoration of united Poland and Lithuania and forcefull removal of the French from Eastern Europe. While he was young he was bonapartist, however later he got dissapointed with Napoleon, because of objectification of nations of Eastern Europe. Later all of his views were put in his literature. One of most famous, if not the most famous, books was "Forefathers' Eve III". It told story of prisoners and few other people in Baltic Duchy and North-Eastern Poland that met French opression and many other problems caused with organisation of Napoleon's dominions. In this book he antagonized French and Russians, however in postscript "To my friends Muscovites" he sympathized with Russians opressed by Tsar. Later in 1828 he was arrested, in 1834 sent to "exile" to France where he was in home arrest until 1837, later he could travel in France, but was constantly under surveillance by French spies. During that period he wrote many of his books. In 1852 he escaped France and travelled to Istanbul, Ottom Empire. He was welcomed there. Despite many wars between PLC and Ottomans in the past Poles were respected in Empire, because of victory at Vienna in 1683. In 1853 he met with current Sultan and became official representant of Polish political exiles. From that point of time Istanbul became main place of meeting of Polish emigration. He died there in 1856 under mysterious circumstances. It is belived that he was poisoned by French or Russian spies, but it causes much controversy. Nowadays he is considered a great poet that was creating for maintenance of resistance in Polish and Lithuania people. Some people consider him Messiah, especially because of book "Forefathers' Eve III", but also "Mister Tadeusz" and "Konrad Wallenrod". He translated many classical books to Polish. Experts say that his book "History of the Future", finished in 1842, had great influence on today's science fiction literature, some experts consider him "father" of that genre."

 deluge_poland.79.d:0 "Emilia Plater was female general of Polish-Lithuanian origin. She was born on 13th of Novemeber 1806 and died on 23th of December 1831. She started Anti-French uprising of 1844 with help of few other people like Maciej Rybiński, Józef Chłopicki or Michał Radziwiłł. She started it in Baltic Duchy, others started it in Kingdom of Poland. It's main target was independent Poland, but she also aimed to liberate Lithuania and combine it in one state with Poland. She was raised in Polish-Lithuanian family, she felt bond to both countries and both of them being disunited under French boot was unacceptable. Despite strong patriarchy in current army she became brave general in very young age. France send army to crush uprising. She died during uprising, because of being shot by French soldier while defending to her last breath. Many people consider her hero and authority for women and patriots. Many people connected year of 1844 to Messiah from book "Forfather's Eve III" by Adam Mickiewicz, so some of them think that she was the "44", the Messiah, especially that her father was Polish and mother was from foreign lineage, so it was compatible with the book. However many discredit her and deny that she was a Messiah, because she was a woman. Nowadays many just don't belive in myth of 44, but still think that Emili Plater is role model for many young people, especially women."

He also was Polish and French general, minister of war and commander-in-chief of the troops of Duchy of Warsaw and later Polish Kingdom. He was only Pole to be titled Marshal of France. He was born in Wien on 7th May 1763. He spent his childhood in Austria where he was being raised to be general or musician. After he became general he still he carried keyboards to the battlefield. In 1778 he took part in Austro-Turkish war, then he saved prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg, who later during Napoleonic wars became his enemy. He was raised by cosmopolitic aristoracy and the only person that saved him from becoming Austrian was his uncle, king of Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski. After war of 1778 he joined Polish miliatry and helped enact Constitution of 3rd May. By joining Polish military he lost all of his contacts in Wien and respect from his childhood friends. In Polish-Russian war of 1792 he turned out to be a great general. He was dissapointed by uncle's decision to cooperate with Russian Tsaritsa Catherine the Great. He wanted to fight with partitioners until his last breath. After lost war he escaped to Wien, when he tried to challenge to a duel main Polish collaborator, from Tagrowica, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki. After king Stanisław Poniatowski, his uncle, joined Targowica, Józef sent his orders gained in Polish military back to the king. After start of Kościuszko's insurrection he joined it. After failure of insurrection he changed his place of living few times and finally stopped at Warsaw that was incorporated intro Prussia. Until 1906 he led a dissolute lifestyle, never married, had many lovers and 2 unlegitimate sons. In 1906 when Joachim Murat entered Warsaw he looked for leader of new Polish army. First candidate was Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, but Joachim decided that he doesn't have enough experience and contacts. Józef Wybicki proposed Józef Poniatowski, who became the minister of war of Duchy of Warsaw and one of Napoleon's generals. He led armies in war with Austria for Galicia, helped Napoleon with conquest of Moscow and became respected and trusted by Napoleon and his other generals. He demanded and brought about that the posts of voyts should be granted to peasants, and not to the local nobility, as was customary. He argued that the courts should be obliged to uniformly apply the more progressive Napoleonic code, and not, at their discretion, also the former Constitution of May 3 or Prussian law, in order to avoid arbitrariness in judicial decisions. He co-founded the Warsaw Medical School, which in 1816 became part of the University of Warsaw. He defended Jews removed by the authorities from the main streets of Warsaw. Persuaded by the elders of the Jewish community that young Jewish conscripts should have the opportunity to observe their religious duties in the army, seeing no way to reconcile this with military practice and discipline, he decided to exempt them from conscription. He died in 1823 because of unidentified illness, propably caused by old battle wounds. Today he is a symbol of Polish revival, reborn and willpower, as well as main hero of Napoleonic wars."

 ##MAIN MENU DESC###
 POL_DELUGE_DESC: "When Napoleon restored the kingdom of Poland as his dominion, he understood the passion Poles have for their fatherland. He exploited it. Did he understand that passion would not be satisfied with subservience to a foreign empire? His ancestor today does not understand. The French, Austrians and Germanns think they taste victory after the Great War in which Poland allied with Hungary, Serbia and lost Pomerania and the whole war, but Poland will never die. Their victory will turn sour in their mouths. The weaklings and cowards occupying Wilno and Minsk will be the first to taste it, but not the last."
