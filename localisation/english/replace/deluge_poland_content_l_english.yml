 deluge_poland.1.t:0 "Question of flag"
 deluge_poland.1.d:0 "Now after we get rid of this useless monarch it’s time to decide what we do with the flag. Our pro-monarchist supporters and others who like eagle with crown may be upset about changing it, but on the other hand there are people who will agree with us."
 deluge_poland.1.a:0 "It's time to move on!"
 deluge_poland.1.b:0 "We should stay with old one."
 deluge_poland.2.t:0 "Death of the Marshal!!!"
 deluge_poland.2.d:0 "Today at 21:37 our dear marshal died. After his usual evening smoking a cigarette on his house’s balcony he didn’t feel well and called his servant to give him some medicine. After taking some painkillers he went to sleep on his sofa and never woke up. The cause of death is probably lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes."
 deluge_poland.2.a:0 "If he only stopped smoking.."
 deluge_poland.3.t:0 "Death of Polish Marshal"
 deluge_poland.3.d:0 "Yesterday at 21:37 Polish Marshal and dictator Józef Piłsudski died. After his usual evening smoking a cigarette on his house’s balcony he didn’t feel well and called his servant to give him some medicine. After taking some painkillers he went to sleep on his sofa and never woke up. The cause of death is probably lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes, but today experts are also considering heart attack. Now the country is ruled by a group of politicians and officers that try to choose a new leader. However now when the country is in chaos there is opportunity for the opposition to do something. Time will show what happens."
 deluge_poland.3.a:0 "Fs in the chat everyone!"
 deluge_poland.4.t:0 "Edward Rydz-Śmigły sizes power in Poland!"
 deluge_poland.4.d:0 "Today morning a Sanation Emergency Council announced that the new Marshal is Edward Rydz-Śmigły, high-rank general and very known hero from the Great War. He is also known for being a far-right activist and by some people is being called “selfish and hypocritical”. Of course that may be false words to dishonor the name of this politician and general, but the time will show the truth."
 deluge_poland.4.a:0 "Shall we be worried?"
 deluge_poland.5.t:0 "Władysław Sikorski takes power in Poland!"
 deluge_poland.5.d:0 "Today morning a Sanation Emergency Council announced that the new Marshal is Władysław Sikorski, a high-rank general and very known hero from the Great War. He is one of the more recognizable leaders of liberal Sanation in government. This will heavily influence the politics of the new government as well as the future of Poland. But only time shows if it comes out as a good thing."
 deluge_poland.5.a:0 "Shall we be relieved?"
 deluge_poland.6.t:0 "Jan Stachniuk is the new leader of Poland!"
 deluge_poland.6.d:0 "Today morning a Sanation Emergency Council announced that the new leader is Jan Stachniuk, politician known for his neopagan nationalism combined with leftist views on the economy. This for many suprise, because he points out that Judeo-Christianity is the main enemy of Poland and Poles should come back to their roots. He also isn’t a soldier so it's the end of the military regime in Poland. For sure he will bring wind of very big changes for Poland, but only time will tell about their effectiveness."
 deluge_poland.6.a:0 "Shall we be surprised?"
 deluge_poland.7.t:0 "Bolesław Piasecki gains power in Poland!"
 deluge_poland.7.d:0 "Today morning a Sanation Emergency Council announced that the new leader is Bolesław Piasecki, known as pro-Christian nationalist. However he never talks about his economic programs. Before the Marshal's coup in 1930 he was connected with ONR-Falanga. Because of this many people think that Sanation’s days come to an end and the ONR-Falanga will be a new party. Also he is not a soldier and he still gets chosen as a new leader, which ends the military regime in Poland. Time will tell what comes out of this."
 deluge_poland.7.a:0 "Shall we be concerned?"
 deluge_poland.8.t:0 "Poland continues Old Foreign Policy"
 deluge_poland.8.d:0 "As we can see new leader of Poland has chosen new politicians for government. One of them is Józef Bek. He admired Józef Piłsudski and wants to make Poland great again. That means expanding [POL.GetFactionName] as alliance "from sea to sea" to stop opression of Eastern Europe from Russia, Germany, Italy and Ottoman Empire."
 deluge_poland.8.a:0 "Nothing new I see..."

He was with Poland during the Great War and there are many opinions about him - some people think that he caused a failure in Great War, while others think of him as a hero. His second son Friedrich Christian Wettin is broken because of loss of his father."
 deluge_poland.9.a:0 "What shall new king change?"
 deluge_poland.10.t:0 "King of Poland died!"
 deluge_poland.10.d:0 "Yesterday at 3:33 king Frederick III Wettin has passed away in his palace in Warsaw. He was with Poland during the Great War and there are many opinions about him - some people think that he caused a failure in Great War, while others think of him as a hero. His second son Friedrich Christian Wettin is broken because of loss of his father. However today he promised in public speech that he is gonna be better king than his father and any king that ever ruled Poland. He also emphasized the problems of current government and promised to fight with his corruption and lead Poland to more liberal Rzeczpospolita."

 deluge_poland.12.d:0 "Today Polish government decided to no longer use Polish Franc, which was used after [POL.GetName] gained independence from France, but stayed in good relation with it, and changed their main currency to Polish Złoty. Because of the recent decline of French Franc Polish economy suffered, but thanks to that and some other decisions of Polish government crisis in gone and Polish currency as well as whole economy is rising to level never reached by it ever before!"

Our officials are already preparing funeral, but there is another important question - who should lead us now?"
 deluge_poland.16.d2:0 "Our great leader died this night because of pneumonia in Drozdów. He was ill from some time, he was resting in his friend's house in countryside away from politics. Our officials are already preparing funeral. He did many things to our fatherland. Rest in peace."
 deluge_poland.16.d3:0 "Leader of National Democracy, far-right, but democratic party, died this night because of pneumonia in Drozdów. He was ill from some time, he was resting in his friend's house in countryside away from politics. Endecja's officials are already preparing funeral."

 deluge_poland.17.d:0 "Today marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły from balcony of his home proclaimed the creation of Greater Polish Empire. He said that "Polish nation got rid of Jacobins, Jews or other lower races. It dominated Europe and soon will dominate the world! That’s why there is no reason to hide our greatness from others!" This speech was met with big happiness from crowd! Opposition that hides in sewers criticizes it, but no one cares about their mind."
 deluge_poland.17.a:0 "New Age for Poland begins..."
 deluge_poland.18.t:0 "New Dawn in Poland!"
 deluge_poland.18.d:0 "Today president of [POL.GetName] [POL.GetLeader] proclaimed New Dawn for his country. New ruling democratic party - Front Morges - recently took peacfully power from already disbanded Sanation Government. It happend because of Władysław Sikorski - Polish Marshal, who after death of previous Marshal, Józef Piłsudski, took power and slowly reformed the country. [POL.GetLeader] said that New Dawn means for him age of prosperity, happiness, progress and democracy. Many Poles are thankfull to Władysław Sikorski for all his deeds, however there are many followers of Sanation that are not happy with current state of [POL.GetName]."
 deluge_poland.18.a:0 "New Age for Poland begins..."
 deluge_poland.19.t:0 "ND and PSL start to cooperate"
 deluge_poland.19.d:0 "Gossips tell that PSL and ND started to cooperate underground against the current totalitarian government. They want to bring back free elections and other liberal elements to Poland. However they sometimes dispute about details. ND wants catholic, capitalist Poland, while PSL wants secular, more socialist Poland."
 deluge_poland.19.a:0 "But will they succeed?"
 deluge_poland.20.t:0 "Question of monarchists"
 deluge_poland.20.d:0 "Several people with noble background and/or connections started to approach the anti-sanation coalition. Several of these persons are staunch monarchists, who lobbied to establish a french-style royal government for a very long time, but since the Sanation has many voices opposing Friedrich III and favour a new republican system, they came forward to seek cooperation. The leader of this monarchist coalition is Aleks Ćwiakowski, proposed a temporary alliance to the ND-PSL coalition, in exchange for keeping the king in power. If we let them in then it’s more possible that the plot succeeds, but they can be a danger later."
 deluge_poland.20.a:0 "We need them."
 deluge_poland.20.b:0 "We don't need them."
 deluge_poland.21.t:0 "Question of Radicals"
 deluge_poland.21.d:0 "Key members of the left-wing parties came forward as well, after the monarchists approached us. Artur Śliwiński and Jędrzej Moraczewski mediated between several radical groups and convinced the moderates, to vote him authority over a possible alliance between us and the jacobins. The radicals promised, that they won't oppose the new democratic government, in exchange they asked for several seets in the new Cabinet. Maciej Rataj seemed convinced, but Roman Dmowski was skeptical. If we invite them then it will be easier for succeeding of plot, but they can later become dangerous."
 deluge_poland.21.a:0 "We need them."
 deluge_poland.21.b:0 "We don't need them."
 deluge_poland.22.t:0 "King is concerned"
 deluge_poland.22.d:0 "His Majesty have eyes and ears in many places. He is concerned about recent changes within the country and he does not feel safe, especially for his family. Recent events in Germany and Hungary showed him, that the radical jacobin threat is quite formidable, even within Poland. With several members of the pro-monarchist inner circle, he made precautions several years ago to flee the country if the political situation turns against the crown. Now with the death of the Marshall, His Majesty seems convinced, that there is a chance for another radical revolution. Temporarily, the royal family could go for [SWE.GetName] in disguise as a royal visit. The King either could go with his family or stay. If he leaves, he would be safe, but by leaving, he wouldn't be able to protect his position if the new regime turns against the crown."
 deluge_poland.22.a:0 "The King leaves with his family to [SWE.GetName]."
 deluge_poland.22.b:0 "The King stays."
 deluge_poland.23.t:0 "State of emergency declared!"
 deluge_poland.23.d:0 "The Sanation Emergency Council still struggles, to elect their new leader. However, they are concerned, that the opposition might use the current political chaos and force them to step down. To prevent this, the Emergency Council discussed and voted on declaring martial law. The justification for this act was vague accusations, that they have knowledge about several active jacobin weapon caches in Warsaw to support an armed revolt against the crown. Now the army is on the streets and leaving home after 22:00 is only possible for people that work or travel at these hours."
 deluge_poland.23.a:0 "1981 once again?"
 deluge_poland.86.t:0 "Circle of God's Cause infiltrated our country!"
 deluge_poland.86.d:0 "There are rumors that many opposition leaders came back to Poland from Constantinople. They created "Third Carograd Clique" opposition milieu in exile. First Carograd Clique was established by Adam Mickiewicz against French opression in Poland, second was established against tyranny of king George I. Many members of Third Carograd Clique became members of religious sect called "Circle of God's Cause", sect that believes in the coming of a new era, bringing the coming of God's Kingdom on earth closer, the significant role of the Polish nation in the historical process, even a messianic role. They also criticize institutionalized religious forms. They are convinced that every human being has hidden within himself the absolute knowledge given to him by God. There are people who say that also they infiltrated our government too! And no matter what happens they want power to realize their dream of Messianist Poland."
 deluge_poland.86.a:0 "Oh no!"
 deluge_poland.24.t:0 "Plot against Sanation succeedes!"
 deluge_poland.24.d:0 "The plot has been success! All over the country soldiers rejected serving Sanation and helped us inprison all of their leaders like Edward Rydz-Śmigły, Jan Stachniuk or Bolesław Piasecki. Some of them were given amnesty like Władysław Sikorski. Now we can declare end of state of emergency and push forward to the future!"

 deluge_poland.27.d:0 "Recent conquest of most of Eastern and Central Europe by Poland led to gaining territories of questioned "Lechitic Empire". According to chronicle written by Polish bishop Prokosz Lechitic Empire existed long before Rome, even in times of Alexander the Great. Circumstances of dissapearing of this empire are unknown, but many historians think that's just bullshit. But it didn't stop polish government from "reclaiming" this empire."

 deluge_poland.28.d:0 "Recent unification of western Slavs was made by Poland. After taking back Pomerania and gaining Czechia and Slovakia all nations are united. Polish government is led by pan-slavist ideologists so expanding this union into union all of Slavs is possible."

 deluge_poland.29.d:0 "After Polish conquest of all Slavic countries it was sure that Polish government will decide to create that kind of union.

These shrines are sometimes found by foresters and mushroom pickers, however no one was ever seen praying to them - people say that they propably go pray there at night, but no one wants to check out.

While marching through city people that saw these reacted in 2 ways: ran away screaming or they stood staring and stunned. Followers were stopped at the main street of Białystok by police. Officers demanded from followers to surrender, go with them to police station and they wanted to take prophet Ilja from the cross. But prophet was already dead. Members of cult disagreed to police demands and started to fight with them, however their primitive weapons of sticks and pitchforks couldn't stand a chance against guns. All members of sect that were at that event died shot by the police. Cleaning the street will take some time and this street will be closed for next week or 2. All bodies were already transported and prepared to be buried, but someone at night stole body of prophet Ilja and the cross. Police checked the village of Wierszalin next morning and it turned out that Eliasz's body was once again crucified on the cross next to the main entrance to the village. Police took the body, however they left the cross, because they feared more attempts of remnants of cult stealing it. Some people are sometimes seen next to the cross praying, however these are rare cases. Wierszalin village is abandoned and cult stopped to exist, some members that didn't took part in march might still belive in Klimowicz, however they cause no issues and they do not live at Wierszalin.

 deluge_poland_lore.3.d:0 "Śmigus dyngus is a custom of pouring water on each other. It was believed that dousing oneself with water was supposed to promote fertility, which is why the dousing was mainly applied to married girls, for this reason the rituals of pouring water on one another were sometimes matrimonial in nature. After syncretism with Christianity, it was established in some regions that on the third day of Easter, maidens and girls have the right to reciprocate for being poured with water earlier. During the Christianization of Poland, this tradition took on a second meaning - pouring water on people in front of churches so that they would not go to them, which was supposed to slow down the Christianization. This tradition dates back to Wanda's times. Wanda is the heroine of the legend according to which she was the daughter of Krak and the princess of the Vistula tribe with the capital in Krakow. Wanda did not agree to marry the German prince. The offended prince invaded the lands of the Vistulans with his troops. The army under the command of Wanda managed to repulse the attack. Wanda, however, decided to commit suicide by throwing herself into the Vistula river so as not to provoke further invasions. Benedykt Chmielowski (author of one of the first Polish encyclopaedias) dates Wanda's death to 750 AD. Some historians claim that Śmigus and Dyngus used to be 2 separate customs, but in the oldest sources these 2 traditions were already combined into one. Stanisław Szober's Dictionary of Correct Polish mentions it as one holiday.\n\nDespite the passage of time, this holiday was still celebrated, especially in the villages. Recently, because of our coming to power, this holiday also returned to its 2nd meaning - to scare people away from churches. The popularity of folklore is growing, and the popularity of the Christian religion is slowly decreasing."

The priests strongly condemn this custom because it is a custom of the old faith, however, this custom survived the Christianization of Poland and is celebrated even today, especially in the countryside, especially by children who enjoy making an effigy and then drowning it. In other Slavic countries, similar holidays are also celebrated, e.g. in Ukraine, Marzanna is burned.\n\nAfter our coming to power, the native faith is experiencing its re-blooming, an organization was established associating all Polish native believers, however, it has a strongly decentralized character.

However after May Coup Camp was divided. Those who joined Piłsudski created ONR-Falanga and others joined underground opposition and created ONR-ABC, which later was almost entierly integrated into ND. Since 1930 our party of ONR-Falanga was capable to create big and high headquarters in centre of Warsaw. Main place of talks and speechs, on the highest floor of the building, was inspired by that circus, previous place of meetings. Yesterday leader of ONR-Falanga and newly elected leader of Poland Bolesław Piasecki made a speech. He said that he will restore religious character of Poland that was destroyed by Sanation. This caused outrage in ranks of Piłsudski's followers, however after recent purges they didn't want to oppose new leadership anymore. He also stated that his main goal will be eliminating unwanted elements in the country, especially minorities, slightly reforming school and healthcare systems, church rehabilitation and reintegration of ONR-ABC members. Many members of Sanation thinks of ONR-ABC members as traitors, however Piasecki doesn't see it like this. He thinks that they had reasons to oppose Sanation - previously catholic nature of Poland was being destroyed by Sanation, so opposing it from outside was justifiable. However Piasecki thinks that his method was better - destroying it from inside, like Konrad Wallenrod destroyed Teutonic Order."

Since 1813 the Kwiek family became almost a "royal dynasty" of the Roma of Poland with some recognition by local police and government officials. They discredited other pretenders to this title. Recently Gypsy community gathered in the National Army Stadium in Warsaw to chose their king from 5 candidates, all from Kwiek family. 30 Roma senators voted and they chose Janusz Kwiek. Then the royal crown was consecrated by the Orthodox clergy, and the subjects took an oath to the king. Then the Archbishop of Warsaw performed the coronation, a gypsy choir performs, subjects offer the king flowers, gold or other gifts, senators give the king bread and salt, and finally the gypsy Senate hands the king the insignia. After the coronation, the king thanks the senate and his subjects, as well as the Polish authorities and the gathered guests. The king delivers a speech to the gathered audience in the Romani language, which is directly translated into Polish. At the very end there are various performances by Gypsy artists. Janusz Kwiek was crowned as Janos I before thousands of people, with several European heads of state invited. Only Benito Mussolini came. Janusz Kwiek petitioned Mussolini for land for a Roma settlement in African lands if Italy conqueres any, however Mussolini's answer wasn't clear.\n\nMany people find this day happy, as a reason to celebrate, however many citizens, especially from countryside and other cities are concerned that Gypsies are gonna create their own country inside our country.

From his youth, he was educated in a religious environment - in Jesuit schools. Over time, he took minor orders, but did not complete his theological and philosophical studies. Then he helped teachers and priests in religious schools and churches. He tried to convert Orthodox inhabitants of Poland to Catholicism. After the Cossacks occupied Vilnius, the entire Catholic Transnipal region was attacked because of their abandonment of the Orthodox faith. Catholic churches and schools were destroyed, and clergy and monks were murdered. Bobola returned from Vilnius to Pinsk, but he quickly had to flee from the attacking Cossacks. He took refuge in the village of Mohylno, but was betrayed by the Orthodox population. A Cossack unit captured Andrzej, who was escaping in a cart, and tried to force him to renounce his faith by using threats. This had no effect, so the knights stripped him of his clothes, tied him to a fence and beat him with chains. Then they untied him, beat him in the face (knocking out his teeth), and then tied him to two horses and set off to Janów Poleski. When Andrzej lost consciousness, he was beaten again with swords. When they reached the town, the knights took him to court, but one of the Cossack men-at-arms tried to inflict a mortal wound on him with a sword. Bobola covered himself with his hand and lost three fingers, but he avoided death. To subject him to further torture, he was taken to the slaughterhouse of Grzegorz Hołowczyk, where he was burned with fire, splinters were driven into his fingernails and his skin was stripped. Moreover, his eye was pierced, his nose and tongue were cut off, and finally he was hanged by his legs. Despite this, Bobola did not deny his faith. He died on May 16, 1657 after receiving two saber blows to the neck.\n\nIn 1712, an attempt was made to convince the Pope to beatify Andrzej Bobla, but it failed. In 1826 they tried again, but the pope responded only in 1853. Then Pope Pius IX issued a solemn decree allowing the beatification of the martyr, recognizing the miraculous healing of three children through the intercession of Andrzej Bobola. Then, in the canonization process, Pope Pius XI, on March 16, 1937, recognized the miraculous healings of Ida Henryka Kopecka and Alojzy Dobrzyńska, a nun from the Order of Servants, which were allegedly caused by blessed Andrzej Bobola. Now preparations are underway for the official canonization ceremony of Andrzej Bobola in the Vatican."

While he was young Napoleon with his Grand Army and Józef Poniatowski were marching to Russia through his village in Lithuania. He studied in Vilnius. Later when new order in Eastern Europe was established he dissatisfied and opposed to it. It diveded Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into Ukraine, Belarus, Baltic Duchy and Poland. He thought that dividing Poland and Lithuania at that moment was bad decision, because many people thought about themselves as Polish-Lithuanians. There were many mixed families, especially in the east of the country. Many people in Lithuania still spoke Polish. He didn't think the same about Ukraine and Belarus, he pointed only that their national identity were not fully developed. He also thought that Baltic Duchy is not fully stable country, because it combined Lithuania, which at that time was closer to Poland, with Lativa, which at that time was influenced by German, Russian and Lithuania cultures, and Estonia which was closer to Northern Europe. He wanted restoration of united Poland and Lithuania and forcefull removal of the French from Eastern Europe. While he was young he was bonapartist, however later he got dissapointed with Napoleon, because of objectification of nations of Eastern Europe. Later all of his views were put in his literature. One of most famous, if not the most famous, books was "Forefathers' Eve III". It told story of prisoners and few other people in Baltic Duchy and North-Eastern Poland that met French opression and many other problems caused with organisation of Napoleon's dominions. In this book he antagonized French and Russians, however in postscript "To my friends Muscovites" he sympathized with Russians opressed by Tsar. Later in 1828 he was arrested, in 1834 sent to "exile" to France where he was in home arrest until 1837, later he could travel in France, but was constantly under surveillance by French spies. During that period he wrote many of his books. In 1842 he escaped France and travelled to Istanbul, Ottom Empire. He was welcomed there. Despite many wars between PLC and Ottomans in the past Poles were respected in Empire, because of victory at Vienna in 1683. In 1842 he met with current Sultan and became official representant of Polish political exiles. He also convinced Sultan to stop recognizing current Polish government. This hurt Ottoman-French relations. From that point of time Istanbul became main place of meeting of Polish emigration. He died there in 1856 under mysterious circumstances. It is belived that he was poisoned by French or Russian spies, but it causes much controversy. Nowadays he is considered a great poet that was creating for maintenance of resistance in Polish and Lithuania people. Some people consider him Messiah, especially because of book "Forefathers' Eve III", but also "Mister Tadeusz" and "Konrad Wallenrod". He translated many classical books to Polish. Experts say that his book "History of the Future", finished in 1842, had great influence on today's science fiction literature, some experts consider him "father" of that genre."

Józef Wybicki proposed Józef Poniatowski, who became the minister of war of Duchy of Warsaw and one of Napoleon's generals. He led armies in war with Austria for Galicia, helped Napoleon with conquest of Moscow and became respected and trusted by Napoleon and his other generals. He demanded and brought about that the posts of voyts should be granted to peasants, and not to the local nobility, as was customary. He argued that the courts should be obliged to uniformly apply the more progressive Napoleonic code, and not, at their discretion, also the former Constitution of May 3 or Prussian law, in order to avoid arbitrariness in judicial decisions. He co-founded the Warsaw Medical School, which in 1816 became part of the University of Warsaw. He defended Jews removed by the authorities from the main streets of Warsaw. Persuaded by the elders of the Jewish community that young Jewish conscripts should have the opportunity to observe their religious duties in the army, seeing no way to reconcile this with military practice and discipline, he decided to exempt them from conscription. He died in 1823 because of unidentified illness, propably caused by old battle wounds. Many of French high-ranked officials arrived at his funeral. Today he is a symbol of Polish revival, reborn and willpower, as well as main hero of Napoleonic wars."
