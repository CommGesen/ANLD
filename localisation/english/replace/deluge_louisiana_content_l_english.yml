 deluge_louisiana.1.t:0 "Our king is gone"
 deluge_louisiana.1.d:0 "Recently, at the age of 65, our king Jean Pierre Clément Marie, Duke of Guise, passed away. People listen with bated breath to news reports from loudspeakers and radio. The government has already prepared a route for a magnificent funeral procession that will follow the main streets of New Orleans and end at the St-Pierre Cemetery. Even the Spanish king flew out of Madrid to say goodbye to the deceased.\n\nThe son of the late king Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie will ascend to the throne of France as Henri I, who has already sworn to preserve the legacy of the house and his father. Louisiana is entering a new era of anxiety, and the new king will need every effort to preserve the monarchy and the country."

 deluge_louisiana.2.t:0 "Demise of the French king"
 deluge_louisiana.2.d:0 "On the night of August 25, King Jean I of Louisiana died in his sleep. His son Henri of Orléans, Count of Paris will soon ascend to the throne as Henri I. The country is experiencing a huge loss, and the king of Spain personally attended the funeral of the deceased. Because of the common ancestry and the disputed right to the throne of France, some find this visit politically biased, which split public opinion into two camps: some believe that it is better for Spaniards to stay apart, when others saw in it a glimmer of hope for the unification of two families."
