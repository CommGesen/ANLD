 #####events:
 turkey.1.t: "Explosion in the Mejlis-i Mebusân"
 turkey.1.d: "An explosion has just occurred in the Parliament, where a car loaded with dynamite detonated, resulting in the tragic loss of lives, including some minority members. This heinous act is believed to have been carried out by ultranationalists with the intention of disrupting the ongoing parliamentary session."
 turkey.1.a: "Mon Dieu"

 turkey.2.t: "Protests in Damascus"
 turkey.2.d: " Among the casualties were prominent individuals, including Wasfi al-Atassi, a revered nationalist figure within the Syrian Vliyats. Many mourn his loss, perceiving his death as part of a broader agenda orchestrated by the Young Turks to diminish the influence of Arabs within the empire."
 turkey.2.a: "Shadow Government is a lie, right?"

 turkey.3.t: "Riots in Baghdad"
 turkey.3.d: "In Baghdad, unrest has erupted in the aftermath of the demise of Sassoon Eskell, the Jewish-Baghdadi minister of finance. Eskell, who had earned the respect of the people during his tenure as Wali and later as minister, has left a void that is deeply felt. Frustration is mounting among Baghdadis as investigations into his death yield no substantial results, prompting widespread protests and unrest in the city."
 turkey.3.a: "Can you Guys Calm Down"

 turkey.4.t: "Frame the Young Turks?"
 turkey.4.d: "It appears there is a chance to frame the attack to the Young Turks as a move to eliminate their influence. While this approach may seem tempting to some, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences and ethical implications of such a decision. False accusations can exacerbate tensions and lead to further unrest. It is advisable to thoroughly assess the situation, gather evidence, and pursue a course of action that promotes justice and stability without resorting to baseless accusations."

 turkey.4.b: "We Can do it alone"

 turkey.6.t: "Arab Liberation Coup"
 turkey.6.d: "It appears that the Arab Generals we dispatched with armies to secure strongholds for a potential civil war have betrayed us. They have declared the dissolution of the Empire, and the Young Turks have proclaimed the establishment of a Republic. President Fevzi Pasha has stated that the Sultan must abdicate all of his titles and promptly depart for Paris."
 turkey.6.a: "Well We have had a good run"

 turkey.7.t: "The People's Revolution"
 turkey.7.d: "It appears that the Republican People's Party orchestrated the discord in our empire to spark a revolution. Due to our focus on overthrowing the Young Turks, we overlooked the activities of a few radicals. With only a few days before they reach Istanbul, immediate escape is crucial."
 turkey.7.a: "Pack your Bags Fast"

 turkey.8.t: "The Prince's Coup"
 turkey.8.d: "Prince Osman Fuad, fed up with the ongoing political turmoil, took decisive action by rounding up high-ranking members of the Young Turks. In a bold and drastic move, he ordered their execution on the streets, culminating in the shooting of Fevzi Pasha at the doors of the Mejlis."
 turkey.8.a: "This pretty bloody"
