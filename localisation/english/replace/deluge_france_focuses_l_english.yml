 ###POLITICAL TREE###
 
 FRA_may_day_results:0 "May Day Results"
 FRA_may_day_results_desc:0 "Social upheavals have been the scourge of French society since the end of the Great War, and the people have one day a year, which is a collective echo of all the problems of the working society that is trying to reach the top. May Day has died down in the country, which means the government needs to analyze past events."
 
 FRA_towards_republic:0 "We Need a Republic"
 FRA_towards_republic_desc:0 "Autocratic monarchs have oppressed the average Frenchman since time immemorial. The time has come to put an end to these bloodsuckers by overthrowing the dictatorial rule of the House of Bonaparte, which in practice is no different from the rule of any other tyrant with a throne."
 FRA_soldiers_solidarity:0 "Soldiers' Solidarity"
 FRA_soldiers_solidarity_desc:0 "Today, the whole country is divided, including the army. We must convince those who hesitate that the Republicans are capable of taking care of France and its armed forces. We must unite all soldiers under the banner of Republicanism. To do this, it is worth starting an agitation campaign among junior ranks and ordinary soldiers."
 FRA_secure_city_dwellers:0 "City and Proletariat"
 FRA_secure_city_dwellers_desc:0 "Cities are an important part of any civilized and modern society, they form part of a large industrial organism and the most progressive thoughts are cultivated in them. To win the support of the whole people, we must first start propaganda among urban residents and workers."
 FRA_public_opinion:0 "Public Opinion"
 FRA_public_opinion_desc:0 "In order to win quickly and meet less resistance, we need to neutralize the habits of the military. Printing companies loyal to us will have to work hard when we increase the circulation of newspapers, posters and leaflets discrediting the military machine."
 FRA_cooperate_with_workers:0 "Get Petty Bourgeoisie on Our Side"
 FRA_cooperate_with_workers_desc:0 "The outdated laws of autocracy cannot keep up with the global economic shift. Capitalist and socialist countries develop differently, but they still develop, and the monarchy, not knowing what to do with small owners, only slows down the country's development with its half-measures."
 FRA_cooperate_with_farmers:0 "Get Petty Farming on Our Side"
 FRA_cooperate_with_farmers_desc:0 "Farmers are having a hard time these days, they are forced to live in constant stress due to the unstable market situation. And the rulers of our authoritarian state, stuck in their thoughts in the 19th century, are unable to take adequate measures to resolve the situation."
 FRA_republic_forever:0 "Republic Forever"
 FRA_republic_forever_desc:0 "There is no more strength to endure, it's time to throw off the emperor and proclaim the Republic, which has been reborn in us, faithful to it cause. There is a lot of work ahead, and the worst is not over yet, but we will cope. Prepare a new proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy, the revolution begins again!"
 
 FRA_another_revolution:0 "Path to Liberty, Eequality and Fraternity"
 FRA_another_revolution_desc:0 "A bourgeois state may be better than an autocratic one, but in the modern world it is also beginning to degenerate and become a new system of oppression of the working people. The people will lose everything they fought for if they fail to bring the revolution to an end. From now on, our republic must become radical."
 
 FRA_anarchist_communist_federation:0 "Building a Classless Society"
 FRA_anarchist_communist_federation_desc:0 "We anarchists are often accused of simply wanting the same old communism, but here and now. Not at all, because in order to fight against the exploitation of man by man, we will need a platform from which to coordinate our actions with anarchists all over the world, so let the state play its final role and help us with this."
 FRA_no_gods_no_masters:0 "No Gods, No Masters"
 FRA_no_gods_no_masters_desc:0 "Our movement is a movement of action, therefore we are obliged to put into practice the principles of a classless society. We will collectivize public transport, the media, and the property of the imperial family; we will introduce a system of popular control in enterprises; and we will democratize the institution of the army. These are just some of the few popular but fair steps."
 FRA_platofrmism:0 "Platformism"
 FRA_platofrmism_desc:0 "The victory of anarcho-communism in France is a great victory, but it was preceded by many defeats. In order to analyze anarchist campaigns around the world and draw conclusions, it is necessary to create an appropriate information system in which a broad discussion will begin."
 FRA_strengthen_the_communes:0 "Expand the Rights of Communes"
 FRA_strengthen_the_communes_desc:0 "Communes are the largest administrative units in the country. With the anarchists coming to power, they should gain even more autonomy and authority. If the people see what we are doing for their freedom, they will repay us with the most honest work and decency."
 FRA_new_norms:0 "New Norms of Life"
 FRA_new_norms_desc:0 "We are forced to coexist with the remnants of the past, with its rotten culture and perverted relationships between people, but this cannot last forever. There is a long propaganda and theoretical work to be done to change public consciousness from individualist to collectivist."
 FRA_synthesis_anarchism:0 "Synthesis Anarchism"
 FRA_synthesis_anarchism_desc:0 "Sometimes it is difficult for us to build a new society, as we are one of the pioneers of anarchism who gained power in the state. To survive, we need more supporters, even if they don't sympathize with communism specifically. We need anarchists of all stripes, without adjectives!"
 FRA_support_individualism:0 "Best Ones Among Equals"
 FRA_support_individualism_desc:0 "All people are created unique, but at the same time unequal in their essence. We should not sweep everyone under one rug, but rather emphasize the merits of those comrades who undoubtedly made a greater contribution to the victory of the people. Let them become examples for those who strive for the best!"
 FRA_no_norms:0 "Subverting Cultural Norms"
 FRA_no_norms_desc:0 "Such oppressive norms as monogamy, marital relationships, the age of consent, animal rights, respecting the dead or honesty towards enemies do not allow us to fully live and develop. We should overthrow them as soon as possible and liberate our citizens!"
 FRA_from_each_according_to_his_ability:0 "From Each According to His Ability..."
 FRA_from_each_according_to_his_ability_desc:0 "The goal of our revolution is to get rid of the parasitic classes and build a society of social equality, and for this we need to demand from everyone what he is ready and able to give the people to accomplish this task."
 FRA_to_each_according_to_his_needs:0 "...to Each According to His Needs!"
 FRA_to_each_according_to_his_needs_desc:0 "We strive for a society that exists without exploitation, and therefore can give more to the common man. Now everyone can receive an equal share of their labor and other social benefits that were previously unfairly distributed by capitalists. As you worked, so you earned!"
 FRA_communal_democracy:0 "Communal Democracy"
 FRA_communal_democracy_desc:0 "Initially, democracy existed as a way of taking into account the opinions of the elite. In modern society, it has transformed into a bourgeois democracy, allowing those with more money to push and lobby their interests. We will introduce communal democracy to the world, a system that now takes into account the voices of ordinary people."
 FRA_expand_anarchism_to_the_colonies:0 "Spread of Anarchism in the Colonies"
 FRA_expand_anarchism_to_the_colonies_desc:0 "By throwing off the yoke of the empire and proclaiming the republic, we have become one step closer to equality and progress, and the people of the nations conquered by France look to us with the hope that we will not continue the destructive policy of oppression. This is true, but we can do more. We must bring the ideas of anarcho-communism to the former colonies and fight together for our peoples!"
 FRA_french_section_of_workers_internationale:0 "Socialist Anti-Dictatorship"
 FRA_french_section_of_workers_internationale_desc:0 "Many radicals dream of building a proletarian state at an accelerated pace, but they do not realize how dangerous such a sharp leap is for society and the economy. But there is still a way to find a balance, which is to allow for some market elements until the country is fully prepared for such changes."
 FRA_workers_democracy:0 "Workers' Democracy"
 FRA_workers_democracy_desc:0 "Only a worker, and not some bureaucrat, official or director, can clearly see the picture of their production. By giving the proletariat more rights, opportunities to vote and make proposals, and sometimes even lead through councils, it is possible to achieve the necessary quality of work and create social stability."
 FRA_decolonisation:0 "Farewell to the Colonies"
 FRA_decolonisation_desc:0 "Colonialism is just as vile a thing as other forms of social oppression. We must give independence to peoples who have never or practically never seen it, having previously trained them in government. The nations we liberated must find their place among others in the world and defend their independence."
 FRA_french_communist_party:0 "The Party of Communists"
 FRA_french_communist_party_desc:0 "The cause of the revolution must pass into the hands of the Communist Party, because only it is capable of leading the country into a future in which there will be no exploited, there will be no exploiters. Strict party discipline, unity of action, and communication with the people in a language they understand will ensure the path to such a future."
 FRA_anti_democracy:0 "[ROOT.FRA_anti_democracyNAME]"
 FRA_anti_democracy_desc:0 "[ROOT.FRA_anti_democracyDESC]"
 FRA_anti_democracyNAME_not_completed_proudhon_circle:0 "Suspension of Democracy"
 FRA_anti_democracyDESC_not_completed_proudhon_circle:0 "Democracy has failed us in many respects, many of the politicians who advocate it are corrupt capitalists and reactionaries. We must temporarily suspend it and during this period of suspension educate society so that it will then be able to choose truly people's governments."
 FRA_anti_democracyNAME_completed_proudhon_circle:0 "Destruction of the Ochlocracy"
 FRA_anti_democracyDESC_completed_proudhon_circle:0 "Experience has shown that democracy is full of capitalist nepots and cosmopolitan opportunists. This is not the government of the people, but the government of the plebs - ochlocracy. It is better to completely ban it, demonize it, and teach the people to take care of themselves and trust the new, national-syndicalist government."
 POL_ListenToOrliczDreszer_has_not_Dreszer:0 "New Specialists"
 POL_ListenToOrliczDreszer_has_not_DreszerDESC:0 "Taking control of a seaborne region is one thing, but landing on an enemy coast is quite another. It is required to take measures aimed at training the commanders and personnel of the Marine Corps. In addition, such people will be useful not only for amphibious assault, but also for forcing rivers and other difficult terrain."
 FRA_maintain_colonial_empire:0 "Socialist Civilizing Mission"
 FRA_maintain_colonial_empire_desc:0 "Many of the peoples we have conquered do not consider themselves French or follow any specific ideology - they live from day to day in their ancient huts of wood and clay. We must preserve our colonies in order to improve the living standards of these people, educate them about socialist values, and convince the people persuading us to decolonize that it is not time yet. Especially since these countries, once free, can be easily enslaved by other non-radical forces."
 FRA_internationalism:0 "International Cause"
 FRA_internationalism_desc:0 "The radical revolution has no right to stop as long as there is at least one state hostile to working people in the world. It is our duty to help humanity unite in solidarity against oppression. Workers of the world, unite!"
 FRA_pacifits_revolution:0 "Revolution Through Diplomacy"
 FRA_pacifits_revolution_desc:0 "Can we win the approval of the foreign working class if we bring them socialism through war? War is for barbarians, but we will demonstrate our peaceful intentions and become an example of fortitude by helping by force only those where social revolution is already taking place."
 FRA_revolution_by_force:0 "Radical Action"
 FRA_revolution_by_force_desc:0 "Revolutionary actions can be stopped by reactionary forces, and therefore we must help the workers of other countries bring the class struggle to an end. We cannot just wait while our comrades are being dragged to prisons and guillotined at this very moment. This is exactly what proletarian solidarity is!"
