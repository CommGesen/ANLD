 ##CHARACTERS
 FRA_deluge_napoleon_vi_name:0 "Napoléon VI"
 FRA_deluge_napoleon_vi_desc:0 "He was born on January 23, 1914.\n\nLouis Bonaparte known as Napoléon VI, son of Victor Bonaparte known as Napoléon V and his wife Empress Clémentine, took the throne at the age of 12 on May 3, 1926 after the death of his father. His mother served as regent until he came of age. Not yet married, he is a true French patriot who wants to maintain the French Empire and lead its inhabitants to prosperity, which is what the title of Emperor of the French obliges him to do. He is well educated in military matters and promotes militarism. His current rule is characterized by centrism and leaving many matters to the parliament. The rule of his father, as well as his mother, has left France in a bad state and it is his task to fix all its problems."
