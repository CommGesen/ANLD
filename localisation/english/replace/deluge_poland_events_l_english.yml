 deluge_poland.1.t:0 "It's All About the Crown"
 deluge_poland.1.d:0 "Now that we've got rid of this useless monarchy, it's time to decide what to do with the state symbols. The crown on the eagle of Piast is an eyesore for those who advocate the abolition of backward monarchy and dictatorship, but our conservative supporters and those who advocate the preservation of historical heritage and tradition strongly oppose the change of the main national symbols. So that this issue does not become another of the many problems of our young government, we need to deal with it now."
 deluge_poland.1.a:0 "It's time to drop the crowns!"
 deluge_poland.1.b:0 "The crown will remain and that's it."
 deluge_poland.2.t:0 "Death of the Marshal"
 deluge_poland.2.d:0 "Breaking news! Yesterday at twenty-one hours and thirty-one minutes our dear Józef Klemens Piłsudski, Chief of State, founder of the Polish Military, Marshal of Poland, fell asleep forever. After he had smoked a cigarette on the balcony of his house as usual in the evening, he felt ill and called his maid to give him medicine. After taking painkillers, he fell asleep on the couch and never woke up. The cause of death is probably lung cancer, but today experts are also considering a heart attack, which could have been caused by smoking abuse. Although his health began to deteriorate a few years ago, he tried not to show it to the end, devoting himself entirely to serving the fatherland.\n\nThe entire country mourns, a national mourning has been declared. Delegations arrive from various countries, including Hungary and Serbia, to bid farewell to Pilsudski. After the farewell in Warsaw, the Marshal's body will be taken to Kraków, where he will be given a full funeral and buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of Saints Stanislaus and Wenceslaus on Wawel Hill."
 deluge_poland.2.a:0 "If only he would quit smoking..."
 deluge_poland.3.t:0 "Death of Piłsudski"
 deluge_poland.3.d:0 "Yesterday at twenty-one hours and thirty-one minutes, Józef Klemens Piłsudski, Marshal of Poland, has passed away. After he had smoked a cigarette on the balcony of his house as usual in the evening, he felt ill and called his maid to give him medicine. After taking painkillers, he fell asleep on the couch and never woke up. The cause of death is probably lung cancer, but today experts are also considering a heart attack, which could have been caused by smoking abuse.\n\nThe power vacuum in the country has been filled by a group of officials and officers who are trying to decide on their next steps. However, now that uncertainty has ripened in Polish politics, the opposition, driven underground, has an opportunity to do something. What happens next, only time will tell."
 deluge_poland.3.a:0 "My condolences."
 deluge_poland.4.t:0 "Rydz-Śmigły Becomes Leader of Poland"
 deluge_poland.4.d:0 "This morning, the Sanation Emergency Council announced that it was handing over its powers to Edward Rydz-Śmigły, a high-ranking general and a renowned hero of the Great War. This man is also known for his far-right views, and in circles personally hostile to him, he is called selfish and hypocritical. His candidacy is undoubtedly an extreme option, but there is nothing surprising in its election, since, despite the words that discredit the name of this prominent general, this is a logical and natural work of the policy of authoritarianism and dictatorship built over the past two decades."
 deluge_poland.4.a:0 "Extreme is not the word!"
 deluge_poland.5.t:0 "Sikorski Becomes Leader of Poland"
 deluge_poland.5.d:0 "This morning, the Sanation Emergency Council announced that it was handing over its powers to Władysław Sikorski, a high-ranking general and a renowned hero of the Great War. He is one of the most recognizable leaders of the liberal wing of Sanation and one of the most respected people in the government. Many in the Polish upper crust believe that his election will be the first step towards reforming the reactionary system of the state and democratizing the regime. Another matter is whether they see positive aspects in this, since his appointment has caused a heated debate among the ruling elite."
 deluge_poland.5.a:0 "But will he succeed?"
 deluge_poland.6.t:0 "Stachniuk Becomes Leader of Poland"
 deluge_poland.6.d:0 "This morning, the Sanation Emergency Council announced that it was handing over power to Jan Stachniuk, an ideologist known for his neo-pagan nationalism combined with leftist views on the economy. The ideas that «Judeo-Christianity is Poland’s main enemy» and that «Poles should return to their pagan roots» are new to the public. However, it is worth noting that Stachniuk has little connection with the army in general and the generals in particular, so this could mean the end of the militaristic regime. At least as we know it..."
 deluge_poland.6.a:0 "Unexpected, but interesting."
 deluge_poland.7.t:0 "Piasecki Becomes Leader of Poland"
 deluge_poland.7.d:0 "This morning, the Sanation Emergency Council announced that it was handing over power to Bolesław Piasecki, a politician known for his pro-Christian nationalist views. His choice has shocked even some government officials, since Piasecki not only keeps quiet about his plans for the economy, but is also the leader of an extremist group that is heavily modeled on fascist Italy. Poland's ruling elite has reason to fear that his own party will outgrow Sanation and put an end to its rule."
 deluge_poland.7.a:0 "Another Mussolini, yes?"
 deluge_poland.8.t:0 "Poland Will Not Change Its Foreign Policy"
 deluge_poland.8.d:0 "As can be seen from recent actions, the new leader of Poland has hired new people to the government. One of them is the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Józef Beck. An admirer of Józef Piłsudski, he wants to expand the influence of Poland and its faction «from sea to sea» to stop the expansion of all aggressive neighbors."
 deluge_poland.8.a:0 "Expand so that others do not expand. Well yeah..."
 deluge_poland.9.t:0 "Our King is Gone"
 deluge_poland.9.d:0 "Yesterday, at three o'clock and thirty-three minutes, King Frederick I Wettyn of Poland died in his palace in Warsaw. There are many opinions about him — some believe that his rule was the reason for the country's defeat in the Great War, others consider him a hero, but whatever opinion they held about him, he was with Poland until the end of his years. His second son Friedrich Christian Wettyn is shocked by the loss of his father, but today he promised in a public speech that he would be a worthy king. He hopes to become the pride of the country and meet the expectations of his subjects. The young king also highlighted the problems of the current government and promised to fight corruption and reform the state in a liberal manner."
 deluge_poland.9.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"
 deluge_poland.10.t:0 "The King of Poland is Gone"
 deluge_poland.10.d:0 "Yesterday, at three o'clock and thirty-three minutes, King Frederick I Wettyn of Poland died in his palace in Warsaw. There are many opinions about him — some believe that his rule was the reason for the country's defeat in the Great War, others consider him a hero, but whatever opinion they held about him, he was with Poland until the end of his years. His second son Friedrich Christian Wettyn is shocked by the loss of his father, but today he promised in a public speech that he would be a worthy king. He hopes to become the pride of the country and meet the expectations of his subjects. The young king also highlighted the problems of the current government and promised to fight corruption and reform the state in a liberal manner."
 deluge_poland.10.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
 deluge_poland.10.b:0 "We shall see."
 deluge_poland.11.t:0 "Which university should we support?"
 deluge_poland.11.d:0 "Our funds are limited, so they will only be enough to support one of the three universities. Which one should we support?"
 deluge_poland.11.a:0 "Jagiellonian University in Kraków."
 deluge_poland.11.b:0 "University of Warsaw."
 deluge_poland.11.c:0 "University of Lwów."
 deluge_poland.12.t:0 "New Polish Currency"
 deluge_poland.12.d:0 "Today, the Polish government decided to stop using the Polish franc, which was in circulation after independence from France, and changed its currency to the Polish złoty. The recent fall of the French franc has hurt the Polish economy, but thanks to this and some other decisions by the Polish government, the crisis is gradually fading, and the Polish economy is regaining strength with a new, truly sovereign currency."
 deluge_poland.12.a:0 "Now their economy is unhindered."
 deluge_poland.13.t:0 "Results of Elections"
 deluge_poland.13.d:0 "Elections were held across the country, where citizens decided which political party was worthy of leading Poland into the new era. The polling stations are now closed and the votes are being counted, but it is already possible to say that the victory will go to..."
 deluge_poland.13.a:0 "Polish People's Party!"
 deluge_poland.13.b:0 "National Democracy!"
 deluge_poland.14.t:0 "Head of State Election"
 deluge_poland.14.d:0 "Now that the Polish People's Party has won, it is necessary to decide who exactly will lead our state. There are four candidates to choose from:"
 deluge_poland.14.a:0 "Maciej Rataj"
 deluge_poland.14.b:0 "Artur Śliwiński"
 deluge_poland.14.c:0 "Andrzej Waleron"
 deluge_poland.14.e:0 "Jan Dąbski"
 deluge_poland.15.t:0 "Head of State Election"
 deluge_poland.15.d:0 "Now that the National Democracy has won, it is necessary to decide who exactly will lead our state. There are four candidates to choose from:"
 deluge_poland.15.a:0 "Roman Dmowski."
 deluge_poland.15.b:0 "Marian Seyda."
 deluge_poland.15.c:0 "Jan Mosdorf."
 deluge_poland.15.e:0 "Tadeusz Bielecki."
 deluge_poland.16.t:0 "Death of Dmowski"
 deluge_poland.16.d1:0 "Our country's leader Roman Stanisław Dmowski died last night of pneumonia in Drozdowo, where he had been ill for some time and was resting at his friend's house in the countryside, away from politics. Our officials are already preparing the farewell ceremony and funeral, but the party faces an important question: who will lead the country now?"
 deluge_poland.16.d2:0 "Our country's leader Roman Stanisław Dmowski died last night of pneumonia in Drozdowo, where he had been ill for some time and was resting at his friend's house in the countryside, away from politics. Our officials are already preparing the farewell ceremony and funeral."
 deluge_poland.16.d3:0 "National Democracy leader Roman Stanisław Dmowski died last night of pneumonia in Drozdowo, where he had been ill for some time and was resting at his friend's house in the countryside, away from politics. The party's officials are already preparing a farewell ceremony and funeral."
 deluge_poland.16.a:0 "Tadeusz Bielecki."
 deluge_poland.16.b:0 "Marian Seyda."
 deluge_poland.16.c:0 "Jan Mosdorf."
 deluge_poland.16.e:0 "Rest in peace."
 deluge_poland.17.t:0 "The Greater Polish Empire was Proclaimed"
 deluge_poland.17.d:0 "Today, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły proclaimed the creation of the Greater Polish Empire from the balcony of his house. Here is an excerpt from his speech: «The Polish people got rid of the Jacobins, Zionists and inferior races. Its idea dominates Europe and will soon dominate the whole world! That's why there's no reason to hide our greatness from others!» This announcement was greeted by the crowd with great joy. «Pathetic little groups of the opposition and soft—hearted intellectuals who prowl in the shadows question such a decision, but no one cares about their opinion» — one of the Polish newspapers concluded the Marshal's speech."
 deluge_poland.17.a:0 "Poland is opening a new era for itself!"
 deluge_poland.18.t:0 "The New Dawn"
 deluge_poland.18.d:0 "Today, the leader of the Polish state, Władysław Sikorski, proclaimed the «New Dawn» for the country. The new ruling party, the Front Morges, recently peacefully came to power from the already dissolved government of Sanation. This happened thanks to Władysław Sikorski, Marshal, who came to power after the death of Józef Piłsudski and began to reform the state. Sikorski said that the «New Dawn» means an era of prosperity, happiness and progress for the country and the people. Many Poles are grateful to him for what he is doing, but there are many followers of the old government who are unhappy with the new state of affairs."
 deluge_poland.18.a:0 "Sounds like a good strategy!"
 deluge_poland.19.t:0 "Cooperation of the Democratic Opposition"
 deluge_poland.19.d:0 "There are rumors that the PPP and ND have started an underground cooperation against the government. They want to return free elections to Poland and liberalize the country in general. However, their coalition has not reduced the disputes between the parties, but seems to have multiplied them. At a time when the Polish People's Party wants to see a secular and socially oriented system, the National Democracy stands for a Catholic and free-market one."
 deluge_poland.19.a:0 "Fragile coalition."
 deluge_poland.20.t:0 "Coalition with the Monarchists"
 deluge_poland.20.d:0 "Several people of noble origin or with such connections began to get closer to the anti-sanationist coalition. Some of these people are convinced monarchists who have been lobbying for the creation of a government on the French model for a very long time, but since many in the Sanation are against Fryderyk I and in favor of a purely republican system, they turned here for cooperation. The leader of this monarchical coalition, Aleks Ćwiakowski, offered a temporary alliance with the PPP-ND coalition in exchange for keeping the king in power. If we unite, it is more likely that our plan to remove Sanation from power will succeed."
 deluge_poland.20.a:0 "Our coalition is growing!"
 deluge_poland.20.b:0 "We don't need them."
 deluge_poland.21.t:0 "Coalition with the Radicals"
 deluge_poland.21.d:0 "Key members of the left-wing parties also issued a statement after the monarchists approached us. Arthur Śliwiński and Jędrzej Moraczewski became intermediaries between several radical groups and convinced the moderates to vote in favor of a possible alliance between us and the Jacobins. The radicals promised that they would not oppose the new democratic government, in return they asked for several seats in the new cabinet. Maciej Rataj, it seems, did not even have to be persuaded, but Roman Dmowski was extremely skeptical. However, if we unite with them, it will be easier for us to carry out our plans."
 deluge_poland.21.a:0 "Our coalition is growing!"
 deluge_poland.21.b:0 "We don't need them."
 deluge_poland.22.t:0 "The King's Concern"
 deluge_poland.22.d:0 "His Majesty has many eyes and ears in government departments. He is concerned about the recent changes in the country and does not feel safe and his family. Recent events in Germany and Hungary have shown him that the radical Jacobin octopus will easily capture any country experiencing national upheavals. Together with several members of the pro-monarchist entourage, he took precautions several years ago to flee the country if the political situation turned against the crown. Now, after the death of the Marshal, His Majesty seems convinced that a revolutionary situation has come to the country. The royal family can find refuge in [SWE.GetName], disguising it as a royal visit. The King will either go with his family or stay. If he leaves, he will be safe, but by leaving, he will not be able to defend his right to power."
 deluge_poland.22.a:0 "We understand what he's risking. Let him flee."
 deluge_poland.22.b:0 "Convince His Majesty to stay!"
 deluge_poland.23.t:0 "Declaration of a State of Emergency"
 deluge_poland.23.d:0 "The Sanation Emergency Council is still in search of a new head of state. Government officials are concerned that the opposition may take advantage of the current political chaos and force them to resign. To prevent this, the SEC discussed and unanimously voted for the introduction of martial law. The reason for this was vague allegations that the government is aware of several Jacobin weapons caches operating in Warsaw, who are plotting an armed uprising against the current government. Now the army has left the barracks and taken to the streets, and it is possible to leave home after 22:00 only for compelling and valid reasons."
 deluge_poland.23.a:0 "Here we are..."
 deluge_poland.86.t:0 "Circle of God's Cause is Already in Poland"
 deluge_poland.86.d:0 "It is no secret that many opposition leaders have returned from Constantinople. In exile, they had an opposition environment called the Third Carograd Clique. The first clique was founded by Adam Mickiewicz, directed against French oppression in Poland, the second — against the tyranny of King George I. A number of members of the Third Carograd clique became members of the Circle of God's Cause religious sect. Its members believe in the advent of a new era, bringing the coming of the judgment of God. In their opinion, as His kingdom on earth is getting closer, the significant, even messianic role of the Polish nation in the historical process is emphasized. They also criticize legalized religious forms, being convinced that every person hides in himself the absolute knowledge given to him by God. Some sources report that sectarians have already infiltrated our government! And no matter what happens, they want to get the power to make their dream of their sacred mission come true."
 deluge_poland.86.a:0 "This was just not enough."
 deluge_poland.24.t:0 "Anti-Sanationist Coup"
 deluge_poland.24.d:0 "The anti-sanationist coup has succeeded! The soldiers in the cities refused to go over to the side of Sanation when the decisive hour came, and helped us to imprison all their leaders, such as Rydz-Śmigły, Stachniuk and Piasecki. Some of them, such as Sikorski, were granted amnesty for their loyalty and trust in us. Now we can announce the lifting of the state of emergency and move forward!"
 deluge_poland.24.a:0 "Finally, the time of dictate is over!"
 deluge_poland.24.c:0 "It's time for the workers to take matters into their hands!"
 deluge_poland.24.b:0 "Now the monarchy will regain power!"
 deluge_poland.25.t:0 "Disloyalty Problem"
 deluge_poland.25.d:0 "In order to ensure the fullness of power and eliminate internal threats, it is necessary to get rid of the opposition in our movement. Some people will have to disappear, but it is no great loss."
 deluge_poland.25.a:0 "Persecute military leaders."
 deluge_poland.25.b:0 "Persecute officials."
 deluge_poland.25.c:0 "Persecute intelligentsia."
 deluge_poland.26.t:0 "Question of the Throne"
 deluge_poland.26.d:0 "For many years, our country has been ruled by the Germans, while they are our eternal enemies. We need to stop this comedy and change the dynasty! Let's choose a new king."
 deluge_poland.26.a:0 "Piast-Riedelski is worthy to rule!"
 deluge_poland.26.b:0 "Czartoryski will be a king!"
 deluge_poland.26.c:0 "And you know what? We don't need a king!"
 deluge_poland.27.t:0 "Uprising of the Lechitic Empire"
 deluge_poland.27.d:0 "The recent conquest of most of Eastern and Central Europe has led to the Poles now considering legitimizing their claims in the eyes of the conquered peoples and other States. According to the chronicle written by the Polish bishop Prokosz, the so-called Lechitic Empire existed long before Rome, back in the time of Alexander the Great. The circumstances of her disappearance are unknown, and many historians believe that this story about this ancient country is just nonsense. But anyway, fiction or not, the world is meeting a new empire."
 deluge_poland.27.a:0 "Now it is definitely in history!"
 deluge_poland.28.t:0 "Creation of Zapadoslavia"
 deluge_poland.28.d:0 "Poland has recently implemented the unification of the Western Slavs. After the return of Pomorze and the merger with Czechia and Slovakia, the Polish government decided to lead the ideology of pan-Slavism. The Polish authorities declare that further expansion of this union is possible up to the unification of all Slavs."
 deluge_poland.28.a:0 "Hey, Slavs!"
 deluge_poland.29.t:0 "Proclamation of the Slavic Union"
 deluge_poland.29.d:0 "The further Poland expanded to the south and east, the more obvious it became that the Poles were striving to unite all Slavic peoples under one flag. Now that this has happened, the entire Polish administration and management system will have to undergo large-scale changes in order to become a new national or even supranational body. The state structure itself will inevitably be federalized, because otherwise it will be impossible to control such a related, but at the same time diverse people."
 deluge_poland.29.a:0 "Now truly one people!"
 deluge_poland.30.t:0 "A new capital?"
 deluge_poland.30.d:0 "Warsaw was the capital for a long time, but it was made such by Sigismund III Vasa, who was not even the Polish king. That's why we need to decide on the choice of our main city!"
 deluge_poland.30.a:0 "Poznań — one of our ancient cities!"
 deluge_poland.30.b:0 "Moscow — the heart of Russia!"
 deluge_poland.30.c:0 "Kiev — the Slavic holy site!"
 deluge_poland.30.e:0 "Kraków — the capital of the Vistula tribe!"
 deluge_poland.30.f:0 "We don't need a new capital."
 deluge_poland.31.t:0 "Our King Died Abroad"
 deluge_poland.31.d:0 "The Polish king Fryderyk I was distinguished by his advanced age and poor health. After the stress caused by popular unrest in his homeland, he died in [SWE.GetName]."
 deluge_poland.31.a:0 "Peace to him, of course, but he escaped after all."
 deluge_poland.32.t:0 "The Polish King Died Abroad"
 deluge_poland.32.d:0 "The Polish king Fryderyk I was distinguished by his advanced age and poor health. After the stress caused by popular unrest in his homeland, he died in [SWE.GetName]. This could create a dynastic crisis in Poland, as the claims to the throne of Fryderyk II — the son of the late king — were shaken due to his father's flight from the country. For this reason, the Polish parliament also has justifications for inviting a new dynasty or even revising the status of the monarchy in general."
 deluge_poland.32.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
 deluge_poland.33.t:0 "The Poles Want to Train Soldiers Here"
 deluge_poland.33.d:0 "[POL.GetName] wants to send several specialized detachments of its soldiers to us so that they can be trained in the harsh and hot conditions of our country. What will we answer them?"
 deluge_poland.33.a:0 "Sure, let's teach them all the intricacies!"
 deluge_poland.33.b:0 "Let them look for another testing ground."
 deluge_poland.34.t:0 "Iran Agreed"
 deluge_poland.34.d:0 "[PER.GetName] has agreed with our proposal to hold joint exercises on its territory!"
 deluge_poland.34.a:0 "Cool!"
 deluge_poland.35.t:0 "Iran Disagreed"
 deluge_poland.35.d:0 "[PER.GetName] has disagreed with our proposal to hold joint exercises on its territory."
 deluge_poland.35.a:0 "Not cool."
 deluge_poland.36.t:0 "Training in Iran Completed"
 deluge_poland.36.d:0 "Finally, our soldiers have completed their difficult training in [PER.GetName]. They can go home now."
 deluge_poland.36.a:0 "We will find a use for their experience!"
 deluge_poland.37.t:0 "The Poles Want to Train Soldiers Here"
 deluge_poland.37.d:0 "[POL.GetName] wants to send several specialized detachments of its soldiers to us so that they can be trained in the harsh and cold conditions of our country. What will we answer them?"
 deluge_poland.37.a:0 "Sure, let's teach them all the intricacies!"
 deluge_poland.37.b:0 "Let them look for another testing ground."
 deluge_poland.38.t:0 "Finland Agreed"
 deluge_poland.38.d:0 "[FIN.GetName] has agreed with our proposal to hold joint exercises on its territory!"
 deluge_poland.38.a:0 "Cool!"
 deluge_poland.39.t:0 "Finland Disagreed"
 deluge_poland.39.d:0 "[FIN.GetName] has disagreed with our proposal to hold joint exercises on its territory."
 deluge_poland.39.a:0 "Not cool."
 deluge_poland.40.t:0 "Training in Finland Completed"
 deluge_poland.40.d:0 "Finally, our soldiers have completed their difficult training in [FIN.GetName]. They can go home now."
 deluge_poland.40.a:0 "We will find a use for their experience!"
 deluge_poland.41.t:0 "Falanga and the King"
 deluge_poland.41.d:0 "Obviously, the King does not support our movement and our actions. We can try to convince him to take our side, but we can also put pressure on him to abdicate in favor of the new king. Or we could abolish the monarchy altogether!"
 deluge_poland.41.a:0 "Piast-Riedelski is worthy to rule!"
 deluge_poland.41.b:0 "Czartoryski will be a king!"
 deluge_poland.41.c:0 "And you know what? We don't need a king!"
 deluge_poland.41.e:0 "We need to put pressure on the king."
 deluge_poland.42.t:0 "Rotation as a Reaction"
 deluge_poland.42.d:0 "After we came to power, some generals applied for service, and some on the contrary resigned. It's not good or bad, we'll just have to get used to the new high command."
 deluge_poland.42.a:0 "Roger that."
 deluge_poland.43.t:0 "Public Election for King"
 deluge_poland.43.d:0 "The election of the monarch is being announced in Poland, candidates can be both from our country and from abroad. According to the Polish tradition of the elective monarchy, the authority to hold such an event is transferred to the Monarchical Council, which has already approved that the king will be elected by public vote, after which it must also approve the result. There are already many people who are ready to take part in these elections, but the Monarchical Council will select only a few."
 deluge_poland.43.a:0 "Can I take part?"
 deluge_poland.44.t:0 "Polish Nobility at the Elections"
 deluge_poland.44.d:0 "The Monarchical Council accepted two houses of the Polish nobility to participate in the elections. This is the Czartoryski house and the Radziwiłł house. Both of them are old, influential families who played an important role in the history of Poland. The applicant from the House of Czartoryski is Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, and the applicant from the House of Radziwiłł is Karol Mikołaj Radziwiłł. Augustyn will soon marry Princess María de los Dolores of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, so his choice will provide an opportunity to establish closer ties with Spain, while Karol... has already married his cousin Izabella Róża Radziwiłłówna and has not yet spoken about his foreign policy plans."
 deluge_poland.44.a:0 "Interesting."
 deluge_poland.45.t:0 "Foreign Nobility at the Elections"
 deluge_poland.45.d:0 "The Monarchical Council accepted two houses of foreign nobility to participate in the elections. This is the Andrássy house and the Tyszkiewicz house. The Andrássy House is originally from Hungary, it is an ancient and influential family. The contender from this house is Andrássy Sandor, a car enthusiast and Nobel laureate, who can also claim the Hungarian throne, so if we chose him, we would have a chance to get even closer to Hungary or even enter into a personal union with it. The Tyszkiewicz House is a Lithuanian family that tends to its historical homeland. The applicant from their house is Aleksander Tyszkiewicz, he proposes to bring Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Ukrainians into one state under the rule of a strong ruler."
 deluge_poland.45.a:0 "It's also interesting."
 deluge_poland.46.t:0 "Karol Mikołaj Radziwiłł Died"
 deluge_poland.46.d:0 "Karol Radziwiłł, the pretender to the Polish throne, died today at three o'clock and thirty-seven minutes in his home at the age of fifty-two. Initially, doctors named a heart attack as the cause of death, his confused wife told the press that he had not previously had any health problems. However, just a few hours ago, experts discovered a large dose of a slow-acting poison in the wine that the deceased drank.\n\nEveryone knew that Karol owned a poultry farm in [SAF.GetName], but only a few knew that there were threats from a competing company there if Karol did not leave the business or if he did not sell it to them. Now no one doubts that it was all set up by competitors. Now his wife, Izabella Róża, has decided to take part in the ongoing elections and promised to show the whole world that Polish justice will get criminals from wherever they hide."
 deluge_poland.46.a:0 "That was unexpected!"
 deluge_poland.47.t:0 "Walewski at the Elections"
 deluge_poland.47.d:0 "An unusual candidate, Andrzej Walewski, was accepted today. He is the son of Alexandre Colonna Walewski, who in turn is the son of Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. Actually, this means that Andrzej is the grandson of Napoleon Bonaparte. However, his grandmother was Maria Walewska, a Polish noblewoman and mistress of the French monarch, so many focus on the fact that he is only a bastard. Andrzej himself says that if he is proclaimed king, he will try to establish relations with France and move closer to the Continental System."
 deluge_poland.47.a:0 "Extremely unusual!"
 deluge_poland.48.t:0 "Piast-Riedelski at the Elections"
 deluge_poland.48.d:0 "Another unusual candidate was accepted today. His name is Paweł Salwator Piast-Riedelski, he claims to come from the Polish royal house of Piast. This family ruled Poland from the beginning of its existence in 966 and essentially died out in 1370. The Monarchical Council, despite the general surprise, accepted it. Little is known about his past, except that Paweł spent his childhood in Germany. Then he moved to Liverpool, where he began to claim that he was the king of Poles and Odorians. Since then, he has written several books, but to this day is mostly unknown. After that, someone even begins to doubt the competence of the Monarchical Council."
 deluge_poland.48.a:0 "Is this some kind of joke?"

Liberals and socialists, radicals and monarchists — all the main opposition circles armed themselves and began seizing government buildings. A huge wave of disobedience caught the army by surprise, and the Polish Military either stood aside and was disarmed, or went over to the side of the rebels. Now we can say that the Polish government has actually collapsed, and its informal leader, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, was arrested and sentenced to death by a hastily assembled tribunal. Another power struggle begins in the country, but without Sanation, whose party property was seized in favor of the state, or divided among others."

Their joint rule led to economic collapse and excessive complication of legislation, which caused dissatisfaction with the military, who later staged a coup. However, the PPP has gained popularity again. Despite the fact that many members of this party were persecuted by the authorities during the Sanation government and lost half of their organizational structure, they were able to become leaders in Polish politics again."

Probably, such a policy of the party contributed to the fact that it did not suffer so much from the Sanation purges, unlike others. There is an opinion that opponents of the general line of Sanation and those who agreed with the opposition have now joined Endecia, looking for a place to continue their careers. However, contrary to this opinion, the ND has won the support of the people. Anyway, the new government promises to build a democratic society with a traditionalist bias."

The farewell ceremony of his main followers, party members and other important political figures took about a day and a half. For some, his death is equivalent to the death of Piłsudski and means the end of an entire era, since Dmowski is considered one of the first National Democrats in Poland, sometimes he is even called the «Father of Polish Nationalism».

Priests and politicians in a number of countries argue that this will contribute to the fact that the powers, whose population is predominantly Christian, will increasingly be drawn into the orbit of [POL.GetAdjectiveCap] influence.

The entire Catholic diaspora is disappointed by the recent politicization of the Vatican and [POL.GetAdjectiveCap] clergy, and calls for building relationships. Some countries that supported [POL.GetAdjectiveCap] actions, were excommunicated by the Pope of Rome from the church, and therefore see no other way but to join [POL.GetAdjectiveCap] church.\n\nThe fate of the Pope, who was recently placed under house arrest and transported to Poland, has also recently become known. There, Pius XII was apparently forced to transfer the papal title to Karol Wojtyła, but during the process, Karol was forcibly captured by unknown mercenaries, presumably hired by the Vatican. During this incident, Wojtyła's guards were fatally wounded during a shootout, but he himself survived — a pistol bullet hit and stuck in the medallion of the Mother of God.

There are a lot of bullet holes and dried blood everywhere, and superstitious people are beginning to say that this place is now inhabited by the ghosts of dead cultists."

Some of them have returned to normal life, while others have started to cause problems in some other areas of Podlachia, although they will soon be arrested for minor crimes they have committed. The cross on which the prophet was to be crucified was driven into the ground next to the main entrance to the village.

 deluge_poland.100.d:0 "After the leader of the Wierszalin Sect was crucified in his village, members of the sect marched from the village to the largest city of Podlachia — Białystok — with a cross showing everyone around them the crucified saint. They thought it would prevent the end of the world, so they celebrated throughout the march as if it were a very joyful event. During the march through the city, people who saw this reacted in two ways: they ran away screaming or stood staring at what was happening in a daze. The followers were stopped by the police on the main street of Białystok. The police demanded that the followers surrender, go with them to the police station and wanted to remove the man from the cross. But the prophet was already dead. The members of the sect did not agree with the demands of law enforcement officers and started a skirmish, but their primitive weapons of sticks and pitchforks could not resist firearms. All the members of the sect who were at that event died, shot by the police. Cleaning the street will take some time, and it will be closed for the next week or two. All the bodies had already been transported and prepared for burial, but someone stole Eliasz Klimowicz's body and the cross itself at night. The next morning, the police checked the village of Wierszalin, and it turned out that Eliasz's body was again crucified on a cross near the main entrance to the village. The police took the body, but left the cross, because they were afraid of new attempts at abduction by members of the cult.\n\nSometimes we can see people praying next to the cross, but these are rare cases. The village of Wierszalin is now abandoned, and the cult has ceased to exist. Some members who did not participate in the march may still believe in Ilja, but they do not create problems and do not live in Wierszalin. This abandoned village and the bloody cross with the blood of the would-be prophet will stand and remind people of what happened."

However, there were French sympathizers among us who condemned this action. After the Great War, their number decreased significantly, but when the official date of the Independence Day celebration was set, they showed up right there and began to criticize this decision. Anyway, this day has been considered Independence Day since 1905, when King Fryderyk I Wettyn decided to establish such a holiday.

 deluge_poland_lore.3.d:0 "Śmigus-dyngus is the custom of pouring water on each other. It was believed that dousing with water was supposed to promote fertility, so dousing was mainly applied to married girls, for this reason, rituals of dousing each other with water sometimes had a marital character. After syncretism with Christianity in some regions, it was established that on the third day of Easter, girls have the right to repay for being doused with water earlier. During the Christianization of Poland, this tradition acquired a second meaning — pouring water on people in front of churches so that they would not go to them, which was supposed to slow down the process of Christianization. This tradition dates back to the time of Wanda.\n\nWanda is the heroine of a legend according to which she was the daughter of a Krak and a princess of the Vistula tribe with its capital in Kraków. Wanda did not agree to marry a German prince. The offended prince invaded the lands of the Vistula with his troops. The army under the command of Wanda managed to repel the attack. Wanda, however, decided to commit suicide by throwing herself into the Vistula River so as not to provoke new invasions. The author of one of the first Polish encyclopedias, Benedykt Chmielowski, dates Wanda's death to 750 AD. Some historians claim that Śmigus and Dyngus used to be two separate customs, but in the oldest sources these two traditions were already combined into one. In Stanisław Szober's Dictionary of Correct Polish, it is referred to as a single holiday. Despite the passage of time, this holiday was still celebrated, especially in the villages.\n\nRecently, in connection with our coming to power, this holiday has returned to its second meaning — to scare people away from churches. The popularity of this folklore is growing, and the popularity of the Christian religion is gradually decreasing."

The priests strongly condemn this, since it is a custom of the old faith, but it survived the Christianization of Poland and is observed even today, especially in rural areas, especially by children who are happy to make an effigy and then drown it. Other Slavic countries also celebrate similar holidays, for example, in Ukraine Marzanna is burned.\n\nAfter we came to power, the local faith is experiencing a new flourishing.

However, after the coup, the camp split up. Those who joined Piłsudski created the NRC-«Falanga», while others joined the underground opposition and created the NRC-ABC, which was later almost completely integrated into Endecja. Since 1930, the party has been able to establish a big and high headquarters in the center of Warsaw. The main meeting place, located on the top floor of the building, was inspired by the previous meeting place.\n\nYesterday, the leader of the NRC-«Falanga» and the newly elected leader of Poland, Bolesław Piasecki, made a speech. He said that he would restore the religious image of Poland, destroyed by Sanation. This caused outrage among Piłsudski's followers, but after the recent purges, they did not particularly want to oppose the new leadership. He also stated that his main goal would be to eliminate undesirable elements in the country, especially harmful minorities, reform the school system and health care system, church rehabilitation and reintegration of NRC-ABC members back into the party. Many sanationists consider members of the NRC-ABC to be traitors, but Piasecki explains this by saying that they had reasons to oppose the government — previously, the Catholic nature of Poland was destroyed by Sanation, so opposition from the outside was justified. «Just as Konrad Wallenrod destroyed the Teutonic Order, so the «Camp» destroyed Sanation from the inside» — Piasetsky finished his speech."

Since 1813, the Kwiek family has become almost a «royal dynasty» of Polish Gypsies, which to some extent was recognized by the police and government officials. This dynasty is known for discrediting other contenders for this title.\n\nRecently, the Roma community gathered at the National Army Stadium in Warsaw to choose their king from five candidates, all from the Kwiek family. Thirty Roma senators voted and elected Janusz Kwiek. His crown was consecrated by the Orthodox clergy, and his subjects took the oath to the king. Then the Archbishop of Warsaw conducted the coronation, the Gypsy choir performed, the subjects presented flowers, gold or other gifts to the king, the senators presented bread and salt to the king, and finally the Gypsy Senate presented the king with insignia. After the coronation, the king thanked the Senate and his subjects, as well as the Polish authorities and the assembled guests. The King addresses the assembled audience with a speech in the Gypsy language, which is directly translated into Polish. At the very end, various performances by Gypsy artists took place. Janusz Kwiek was crowned as Janos I in front of thousands of people, the heads of several European states were invited to the ceremony, but only Benito Mussolini appeared. King Janos appealed to Mussolini to allocate land for the settlement of Gypsies in Africa if Italy conquered them, but Mussolini's response was unclear.\n\nThe Gypsies of Poland consider this day an occasion for a real celebration, but other other citizens, especially from rural areas, are concerned that the Gypsies are going to create a state within the state. Several cases of violence against Roma have already been recorded, and many of our citizens demand that the autonomy of Roma groups in our country be limited."

Since his youth, he was brought up in a religious environment — in Jesuit schools. Over time, he began to serve in the church, without completing his theological and philosophical education. Then he helped teachers and priests in religious schools and churches, and tried to convert the Orthodox inhabitants of Poland to Catholicism.\n\nAfter the Cossacks occupied Vilnius, the entire Catholic left-bank region of the Dnieper was subjected to harassment due to the fact that the inhabitants there abandoned the Orthodox faith. Catholic churches and schools were destroyed, and clergy and monks were killed. Bobola returned from Vilnius to Pinsk, but he had to quickly flee from the attacking Cossacks, he took refuge in the village of Mogilno, but was betrayed by the Orthodox population. A Cossack detachment captured Andrzej, who was escaping on a cart, and tried to force him to renounce his faith by threats. It had no effect, so the knights tore off his clothes, tied him to a fence and beat him with chains. Then they untied him, beat him in the face, thereby knocking out his teeth, and then tied him to two horses and so went to Janów Poleski. When Andrzej lost consciousness, he was beaten with swords again. When they reached the city, the knights put him on trial, but one of the armed Cossacks tried to inflict a mortal wound on him with a sword. Bobola covered himself with his hand and lost three fingers, but escaped death. To be subjected to further torture, he was taken to the slaughterhouse of Grzegorz Hołowczyk, where he was set on fire, splinters were driven into his nails and skinned. Moreover, they pierced his eye, cut off his nose and tongue, and finally hung him by his legs. Despite this, Bobola did not renounce his faith. He died on May 16, 1657, having received two saber blows to the neck.\n\nIn 1712, an attempt was made to convince the Pope to canonize Andrzej Bobola, but it failed. In 1826, there was another attempt, but the Pope did not respond until 1853. Then Pope Pius XI issued a solemn decree authorizing the canonization of the martyr, recognizing the miraculous healing of three children thanks to the intercession of Andrzej Bobola. Then, in the process of canonization, Pope Pius XI on March 16, 1937, recognized the miraculous healings of Ida Henryka Kopecka and Alojzy Dobrzyńska, nuns from the order of ministers, who were allegedly blessed by Andrzej Bobola. Preparations are currently underway in the Vatican for the official canonization ceremony of Andrzej Bobola."

Seeing in Napoleon I a dictator who cares only about the well-being of his country, he was opposed to the idea of creating Polish legions in Italy, because he believed that Napoleon would use them as his tools in French affairs, and not to achieve Polish independence. At the time when Poland was under French rule, he was portrayed in schools and the media as an enemy of these two countries, even though many knew the truth.

 deluge_poland_lore.10.d:0 "Adam Bernard Mickiewicz is a Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian national poet. He spent all his studies in Vilnius. He was still young when Napoleon with his Great Army and Józef Poniatowski marched on Russia through his village in Lithuania. Mickiewicz was dissatisfied with the new order established in Europe and opposed it. He believed that the division of Poland and Lithuania was a bad decision, because many people of that state considered themselves to be one people in principle. For example, there were many mixed families in Lithuania, especially in the east of the country, and many people there still spoke Polish, but he did not have such an opinion about Ukraine and Belarus and only noted that their national identity was not fully developed. He also believed that the Baltic Duchy was not a whole country, since it united Lithuania, which at that time was closer to Poland, with Latvia, which at that time was influenced by German, Russian and Lithuanian cultures, and Estonia, which was closer to the peoples of the north. He dreamed of the restoration of the united state of Poland and Lithuania and the complete expulsion of the French from Eastern Europe. Although he had Bonapartist views in his youth, Mickiewicz later became disillusioned with the Emperor of the French because of the objectification of the peoples of Eastern Europe. Later, all his views were reflected in his literature. One of the most famous, if not the most famous, books was Forefathers' Eve III. It told the story of prisoners and several other people in the Baltic Duchy and Northeastern Poland who faced French oppression and many other problems associated with Napoleon's rule. In this work he contrasted the French and Russians, but in the afterword «To My Muscovite Friends» he sympathized with the Russians oppressed by the Tsar. Later, in 1828, he was arrested, in 1834 he was sent into «exile» to France, where he was under house arrest until 1837, later he was able to travel around France, but was constantly under surveillance by French spies. During this period he wrote many of his books.\n\nIn 1842, he fled France to Istanbul, where he was given a warm welcome. Despite the many wars between Poland and the Ottomans in the past, the Poles were respected in the empire, mainly because of their long-ago victory at Vienna in 1683. In 1842, he met with the current sultan and became the official representative of the Polish political exiles. He also convinced the sultan to stop recognizing the current Polish government. This damaged Ottoman-French relations. From then on, Istanbul became the main meeting place for the Polish exiles. He died there in 1856 under mysterious circumstances. It is believed that he was poisoned by French or Russian spies, but this version has little evidence. Today, he is considered a great poet who wrote to support the resistance of the Polish and Lithuanian peoples. Some even consider him a messiah, especially because of that book «Forefathers' Eve III», as well as «Pan Tadeusz» and the poem «Konrad Wallenrod». He translated many classic books into Polish. Experts say that Mickiewicz's book «History of the Future», completed in 1842, had a great influence on modern science fiction literature, some experts consider him the «father» of this genre."

She started it in the Baltic Duchy, then the uprising spread to the Kingdom of Poland. Her main goal was the independence of Poland, but she also sought to liberate Lithuania and unite it into one state with Poland. Since she grew up in a Polish-Lithuanian family, Plater felt connected to both countries, and their separation by the French was unacceptable to her. Despite the strong patriarchy in the current army, she became a brave military commander at a very young age.\n\nShe died during the suppression of the uprising due to a French bullet, defending herself until her last breath. She is revered as a hero and considered an authority for women and all patriots. There is even a theory that the events of 1844 are directly related to what is written in Adam Mickiewicz's book «Forefathers' Eve III», so someone thinks that she was the same «Forty and Four» — the Messiah, especially because her father was Polish and her mother was a foreigner, as it corresponds the book. However, many discredit this version and deny that she was the messiah because she was a woman. Nowadays, many people simply do not believe in the myth of Forty and Four, but still believe that Emilia Plater is a role model for many young people, especially girls and women."

 deluge_poland_lore.12.d:0 "Wojciech Bartosz was a peasant whose exact date of birth is unknown, but it is believed that he was born around 1758. He became a scytheman during the Kościuszko Uprising. During the Battle of Racławice, he captured a Russian cannon and extinguished the fuse with his cap, which became a symbol of the Polish victory in that battle. Because of this, Tadeusz Kościuszko gave him the surname «Głowacki» and the rank of warrant officer. Despite the difficult living conditions of the peasants at that time, he still fought for the fatherland. Then and today, he is considered a symbol of bravery, a hero of Poland and the Polish peasantry. He died during the Battle of Szczekociny, where he was mortally wounded."

 deluge_poland_lore.13.d:0 "Józef Antoni Poniatowski was the nephew of Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last Polish monarch before the partition of Poland. He was also a Polish and French general, Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw and later the Kingdom of Poland. Poniatowski was the only Pole to receive the title of Marshal of France. He was born in Vienna on May 7, 1763, and spent his childhood in Austria, where he was trained to become a military commander or musician. But he learned both sciences and, after becoming a general, he still took keyboard instruments with him on the battlefield. He grew up in a cosmopolitan aristocracy, and the only person who saved him from becoming an Austrian noble was his uncle, the King of Poland.\n\nIn 1778, he participated in the Austro-Turkish War, where he saved Prince Carl Philip zu Schwarzenberg, who later, during the Napoleonic Wars, became his enemy. After the war of 1778, he joined the Polish army and helped to adopt the Constitution of 3 May. By moving to the Poles, he lost all his connections in Vienna and the respect of his childhood friends. During the Polish-Russian War of 1792, he became a great general. He was disappointed by his uncle's decision to cooperate with the Russian Tsarina Catherine the Great, he was driven by the fight against the separatists to the end. After the lost war, Poniatowski fled to Vienna when he tried to challenge Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, the main Polish collaborator from the Targowica Confederation, to a duel. After King Stanisław Poniatowski, his uncle, joined the Targowica Confederation, Józef sabotaged orders sent to the Polish army. During the outbreak of the Kościuszko uprising, he joined him, and after the failure of the uprising, he changed his place of residence several times and eventually stopped in Warsaw, which was incorporated into Prussia. Until 1806, he led a dissolute lifestyle, never married, had many mistresses and two illegitimate sons.\n\nIn 1806, when Joachim Murat entered Warsaw, he began searching for the leader of the new Polish army. The first candidate was Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, but Joachim decided that he did not have enough experience and connections. Then Józef Wybicki proposed the candidacy of Józef Poniatowski, who became Minister of War of the Duchy of Warsaw and one of Napoleon's generals. He led armies in the war with Austria over Galicia, helped Napoleon in the capture of Moscow, and won the respect and trust of the emperor and his generals. He demanded and ensured that the positions of wójts were given to peasants, and not to the local nobility, as was customary. He argued that the courts should be required to apply the more progressive Napoleon Code uniformly, rather than acting on discretion and using the Government Act or Prussian laws to avoid arbitrariness in judicial decisions. Poniatowski was also one of the founders of the Warsaw Medical School, which became part of the University of Warsaw in 1816. He defended Jews expelled by the authorities from the main streets of Warsaw. Convinced by the elders of the Jewish community that young Jewish conscripts should be able to fulfill their religious duties in the army, and seeing no way to reconcile this with military practice and discipline, he decided to exempt them from military service.\n\nHe died in 1823 from an unidentified illness, presumably caused by old battle wounds. Many high-ranking French officials attended his funeral. Today, Poniatowski's personality is a symbol of Polish rebirth and willpower, as well as the main figure of the Napoleonic Wars in Poland."
