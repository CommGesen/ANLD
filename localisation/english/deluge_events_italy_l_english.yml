 deluge_italy4opt: "Avanti!"
 deluge_italy5title: "Italy Moves Against Croatia"
 deluge_italy5desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her forces, and it seems likely the target intended for [From.GetLeader]'s aggression is the Balkan nation of Croatia. A victor of the Great War, the Croatian state is no doubt willing and able to put up a fight, although victory against her much larger neighbour seems unlikely without outside help."
 deluge_italy5opta: "Avanti!"
 deluge_italy5optb: "Warmongers!"
 deluge_italy5optc: "The fearsome Italian juggernaut."
 deluge_italy6title: "Italy Threatens Albania"
 deluge_italy6desc: "[From.GetLeader] has demanded that the Albanian state subsume itself into [From.GetNameDef] or face destruction. Italian troops are readying for an invasion of the Balkan nation. Albania sided against Italy in the Great War and seized large portions of Serbia from the losers at Versailles, no doubt angering [From.GetLeader]."
 deluge_italy6opta: "Avanti!"
 deluge_italy6optb: "Warmongers!"
 deluge_italy6optc: "Can [From.GetLeader] be stopped?"
 deluge_italy7title: "Greek Independence Threatened"
 deluge_italy7desc: "Italian soldiers and seamen are readying for an apparent assault on the Greek peninsula. Troop ships are swarming in the Adriatic as [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions against the small Balkan state are revealed. The world watches in horror as two of the most prestigious civilisations in history prepare to brutalise one another in open war."
 deluge_italy7opta: "Avanti!"
 deluge_italy7optb: "Warmongers!"
 deluge_italy7optc: "Are the Classics really worth dying over?"
 deluge_italy8title: "Italy Seeks African Colony"
 deluge_italy8desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] was left behind in the Scramble for Africa and lost the few outposts she had won in Libya following the Great War. Now [From.GetLeader] seeks a place in the sun for Italy, with the last free state in Africa, the Christian Abyssinians, selected as the target."
 deluge_italy8opta: "Avanti!"
 deluge_italy8optb: "Warmongers!"
 deluge_italy8optc: "That is so 19th century."
 deluge_italy9title: "Rome Reborn"
 deluge_italy9desc: "[From.GetLeader] has announced the formation of [From.GetNameDef] as the legal successor of Italy. The new radical state, founded on the principles of strength and solidarity between all men, has deposed the French Murat dynasty and replaced King Joachim with a radical Consulship. [From.GetNameDefCap] draws its legitimacy from the most famous of pre-French civilisations to control a unifed Italian peninsula."
 deluge_italy9opta: "For the Senate and People of Rome!"
 deluge_italy9optb: "Solidarity to Consul [From.GetLeader]!"
 deluge_italy9optc: "That is ridiculous."

 deluge_italy11title: "Rome Reborn"
 deluge_italy11desc: "[From.GetLeader] has announced the formation of [From.GetNameDef] as the legal successor of Italy. The new ultranationalist state, founded on the principles of imperialism and national rejuvenation, has deposed the French Murat dynasty and replaced King Joachim with a formal dictatorship.

 deluge_italy12title: "Republicanism in Italy"
 deluge_italy12desc: "[From.GetLeader] has announced the formation of [From.GetNameDef] as the legal successor of the Italian kingdom. The new radical state, founded on the principles of social justice and equality between all citizens, has deposed the French Murat dynasty and replaced King Joachim with a radical presidency. [From.GetNameDefCap] draws its legitimacy from the sovereignty of the people, and repudiates the notion of Italy being the personal possession of a hereditary monarchy."
 deluge_italy12opta: "Italy has awoken!"
 deluge_italy12optb: "Solidarity to President [From.GetLeader]."
 deluge_italy12optc: "A meaningless change of name for the same anarchic tyranny of the majority."

 deluge_italy15title: "[From.GetAdjective] Demands"
 deluge_italy15desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued an ultimatum to [Root.GetLeader]. Unless [Root.GetAdjective] troops withdraw from Tyrol, Trieste and Slovenia, [From.GetAdjective] forces will be mobilised to seize the provinces by force. Though these terms are humiliating, we may be forced to accept them if our situation is untenable. The threat is unlikely to be a bluff. However, we could also try to sap [From.GetAdjective] revanchism by ceding a smaller portion of the demands."
 deluge_italy15opta: "Accede to the demands in full."
 deluge_italy15optb: "Perhaps they will be happy with just South Tyrol?"
 deluge_italy15optc: "Never! We stopped you at the Isonzo before, we will stop you again!"
 deluge_italy16title: "[From.GetLeader] Capitulates"
 deluge_italy16desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has capitulated in full to our demands. This is a glorious moment for [Root.GetLeader], as our brethren in Tyrol have finally been united with the sacred Italian Fatherland."
 deluge_italy16opt: "Glory to [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 deluge_italy17title: "Austrian Cessions to Italy"
 deluge_italy17desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent troops into the formerly Austrian lands of Tyrol and Slovenia. The new borders have been agreed to in a bilateral treaty that, though one-sided and humiliating for the Austrians, are hoped to bring about a permanent peace between the two regional powers. While the Italian-speaking areas in South Tyrol and Trieste have been ecstatic at finally uniting with the Italian nation, the Austrian and Slovenian areas are more subdued."
 deluge_italy17opta: "Hail, immortal Fatherland!"
 deluge_italy17optb: "[From.GetLeader] has his pound of flesh, now leave us in peace."
 deluge_italy17optc: "An incredible feat of diplomacy, no matter what else one thinks of [From.GetLeader]."
 deluge_italy18title: "[From.GetLeader] Cedes South Tyrol"
 deluge_italy18desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has capitulated to an important demand of ours but has rejected the other terms. [From.GetAdjective] forces are withdrawing from South Tyrol and the populace there is celebrating their new union with the Italian Fatherland. This move has taken much of the wind out of our revanchist sails, as we have little claim on the German-speaking regions of Tyrol which remain in Austria. If we press the issue further, we will have little support if things turn sour."
 deluge_italy18opta: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] has won a victory!"
 deluge_italy18optb: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] has been gravely insulted!"
 deluge_italy19title: "Austrian Cessions to Italy"
 deluge_italy19desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent troops into the formerly Austrian province of South Tyrol. Though the Italians are believed to have demanded much more from the Austrians, this offering has pleased most revanchists in [From.GetNameDef] and left the government with little legitimate reason to press for more demands, at least in the eyes of the international community. Whether [From.GetLeader] will stop with this concession or declare an unpopular war for more land remains to be seen."

 deluge_italy20title: "[From.GetLeader] Rejects Demands"
 deluge_italy20desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has rebuffed all attempts at restoring the Italian-speaking regions of Tyrol and Triste to our sacred Fatherland. Though the recent war took its toll on our nation, we are united in our desire to see all Italians united under [Root.GetLeader]'s rule, and a new war against [From.GetNameDef] is widely demanded."

 deluge_italy21title: "Austria Rejects Italian Demands"
 deluge_italy21desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has begun mobilising her troops for yet another attempt at seizing the Italian-speaking regions of Tyrol and Trieste from Austria.

 deluge_italy21optb: "You will fail again, [From.GetLeader]!"
 deluge_italy21optc: "Surely [From.GetLeader] will not go to war again?!"
 deluge_italy22title: "Carrot or Stick?"
 deluge_italy22desc: "Our eyes are set on securing Malta. The naval base would serve as an excellent stepping stone for any hostile invasion of Italy. How should we go about relieving Britain of this island? If we openly request Malta in exchange for joining their military alliance we would forgo any chance at a surprise attack. Of course, if we are already at war with someone, the diplomatic option will simply not be available."
 deluge_italy22opta: "We will join the Commonwealth for Malta."
 deluge_italy22optb: "Frogmen, parachutists, marines! Seize Malta by force!"
 deluge_italy23title: "Alliance with Italy"
 deluge_italy23desc: "[From.GetLeader]'s eyes are set on securing Malta. He has chosen to forgo any surprise attacks on us and ask directly for the small island in exchange for [From.GetAdjective] entry into the Commonwealth. Malta would serve as an excellent stepping stone for an invasion of Italy, but our access to it may not be guaranteed if we are at war with the controller of Gibraltar or Suez."
 deluge_italy23opta: "Welcome to the Commonwealth, [From.GetLeader]."
 deluge_italy23optb: "The Italians are useless, we do not want them on our side again."
 deluge_italy25title: "Anglo-Italian Alliance"
 deluge_italy25desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has requested entry into the British Commonwealth in exchange for the island of Malta. Malta was the home port of the Mediterranean Fleet during the Great War and its stout defenders repelled raids and invasions by French marines on several occasions. This prevented the island's seizure at the Treaty of Versailles, leaving it alone as the solitary British possession in the Mediterranean. Now Malta is in [From.GetAdjective] hands."

 deluge_italy26optb: "Wow, rude!"
 deluge_italy26optc: "It's only fair. They had Italy in the last war."
 deluge_italy27title: "Malta Lost!"
 deluge_italy27desc: "A surprise attack by frogmen, marines and parachutists has overwhelmed the defence force on Malta. [From.GetNameDefCap], our Great War ally, was able to slip ships and aircraft onto the island due to lowered alertness and familiarity between the Italian and British troops. The local commander has surrendered and our troops are being forced out."
 deluge_italy27opta: "Dynamite the magazines before you withdraw. We will return!"
 deluge_italy27optb: "It is a fait accompli. We should recognise [From.GetAdjective] ownership of Malta and normalise relations."
 deluge_italy28title: "Italy Seizes Malta"
 deluge_italy28desc: "Italy has launched a surprise invasion of Malta, taking advantage of the familiarity between Italian and British troops to slip ships and aircraft past the defences. Frogmen, marines and parachutists (many of them veterans of the Great War who defended Malta from repeated French invasions of the island) landed in force and overwhelmed the local garrison, who quickly surrendered. It is unlikely the British will ever retake the island, as it was the last British possession in the Mediterranean after the Treaty of Versailles stripped her of Gibraltar and Egypt."
 deluge_italy28opta: "Damnable traitors."
 deluge_italy28optb: "Avanti!"
 deluge_italy28optc: "A shocking breach of neutrality."
 deluge_italy29title: "Assault on Malta Repelled!"
 deluge_italy29desc: "A surprise attack by frogmen, marines and parachutists has almost overwhelmed the defence force on Malta. [From.GetNameDefCap], our Great War ally, attempted to slip ships and aircraft onto the island by taking advantage of familiarity between the Italian and British troops. The local commander has reported that the attempt has been a failure and our troops repelled the commandos in a quick battle with a few hundred casualties on each side."
 deluge_italy29opt: "Is [From.GetLeader] insane?!"
 deluge_italy30title: "Raid on Malta"
 deluge_italy30desc: "Italy has launched a surprise invasion of Malta, seeking to take advantage of the familiarity between Italian and British troops to slip ships and aircraft past the defences. Frogmen, marines and parachutists (many of them veterans of the Great War who defended Malta from repeated French invasions of the island) landed in force and almost overwhelmed the local garrison. Only the alertness and courage of the defenders saved them from a humiliating surrender. The British were fortunate to cling on to the island, as it is the last British possession in the Mediterranean after the Treaty of Versailles stripped her of Gibraltar and Egypt."
