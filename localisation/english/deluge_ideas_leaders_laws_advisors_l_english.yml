Marie-Adélaïde is not particularly popular as a monarch, performing her duties primarily as a French puppet rather than a unifier or representative of the people."

 american_king_desc: "The line of John II, the House of Hamilton, was not the Founding Fathers' first choice for king. However, George I Washington died without an heir, and Alexander I Hamilton was selected as sovereign by a Constitutional Convention. John II led America competently through the Great War, seizing many British possessions in the Western Hemisphere, and forging closer ties to the French Emperor, Napoleon IV. Like many of his ancestors, he tries to centralise power at the expense of the legislature, to the consternation of the Whigs."

 wettin_king_desc: "Augustus IV is a divisive monarch, to say the least. His ancestors, the Saxon Kings of Wettin, embraced their Polish identity after the loss of their German lands to pan-nationalists and Westphalian invasion. Augustus IV's credentials as a Polish patriot are not questioned: his competence is. As one of the chief instigators of the Central Powers' attack on Austria, radicals and democrats despise him for the bloodshed that followed. Many Poles remain loyal to him, however, for his attempts to bring glory to Poland."
 emperor_puyi: "Emperor Puyi"
 emperor_puyi_desc: "The Xuantong Emperor was only an infant when the absolutist Qing monarchy was forced to cede temporal power to the legislature. However, he still has many advisors around him who talk of restoring the old ways. These corrupt provincial governors, bureacrats and officials were precisely the reason the Qing monarchy lost the support of the people. Now an adult and an accomplished politician and respected diplomat, he may yet win back legitimacy and reverse the trend towards constitutionalism."
 hu_hanmin: "Hu Hanmin"
 hu_hanmin_desc: "The republican movement which sought to topple Emperor Puyi quickly splintered when faced with the many problems they inherited from the monarchists. Threatened with intervention from the Taiping heathens and Japanese imperialists, a majority chose to reconcile with the Qing moderates and win their support, unifying the centrists and conservatives, while the absolutists and radical republicans were left in the cold. Hu Hanmin succeeded Sun Yat-sen as prime minister after the old revolutionist's death in 1925."

The ability of the extreme left to organise on such a large scale surprised the monarchy, but Thälmann took advantage of the disillusionment amongst centrist democrats at the seemingly senseless war their king had thrown them into. Whether the Communists will be able to cement this support into a permanent coalition, or be overthrown in turn, remains to be seen."

Before the Great War, he achieved notoriety for his outlandish theories on racial supremacy, which place Germanic peoples above others in an hierarchy, with Jewish and Slavic peoples at the bottom. In the multinational Austrian Empire, these were not popular beliefs, and he was never appointed or elected to office. He fought in the Great War as a non-commissioned officer in an Austrian regiment, winning many decorations for bravery, and inspiring the loyalty of a following of Great War veterans who now form the base of his support."
 aryan_chancellor: "Aryan Chancellor"
 aryan_chancellor_desc: "Adolf Hitler seized power in Austria with the help of far-right paramilitaries. His stated goal is the unification of all the Aryan peoples under one state, a Greater Austrian Reich.

 habsburg_emperor_desc: "Otto I is the reigning Emperor of Austria. After the destruction of the Holy Roman Empire by the Corsican Tyrant in 1806, the Austrian Empire became the source of Habsburg authority. Otto I led Austria through the recent Great War. Despite many losses in the early days to Poland, Hungary and Italy, he managed to defend his capital until help arrived from the French Emperor, Napoleon IV, who was eager to put the Central Powers back in their place and affirm French dominance of Europe. Otto's reliance on French assistance hurt his credibility amongst the people, but he is a ruthless ruler and competent administrator so the Empire remains stable."
 mormon_president: "Mormon President"
 mormon_president_desc: "Albert McKay is the 18th President of Deseret. The nation was forged by the merger of Mormon settlers fleeing persecution in America and Louisiana, Native American tribes pushed out of the Plains, and Yankee and Louisianan carpetbaggers who opposed the seemingly unending slavery in their native Kingdoms. The three groups often clashed over religion and land, but a Deseret identity grew out of their mutual struggles against Mexican and Louisianan encroachment. The government of Deseret continues to cultivate close ties with other peripheral nations, like the Algonquian and Chan Santa Cruz, but with the recent electoral success of the hardline Mormon Missionary Movement, this policy may change."
 mormon_prophet: "Prophet-President"
 mormon_prophet_desc: "Israel Madison Smith is the fourth Prophet-President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a position usually kept separate from the secular office of President of Deseret. The union of the Church and State presidencies is not unprecedented, but it is usually followed by civil unrest as the non-Mormon citizens become marginalised. Israel Smith is a descendent of Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, and holds strong beliefs about the role of his family as God's appointed regents on Earth."
 hungarian_regent: "Hungarian Regent"
 hungarian_regent_desc: "Field Marshal Horthy was selected as Regent for King Albert in his infancy by the Hungarian Diet, to ensure stability against radicalism. He continues in that role even after the Hungarian defeat in the Great War thanks to his immense popularity with the troops - although his armies were destroyed by the French late in the war, his early victories in Slovakia and Romania seemed to give him an aura of invincibility and lent credence to the boasts of 'home by Christmas'. After the war, Horthy was able to escape blame for defeat by passing it to the radicals and democrats who had opposed joining Poland in the attack on Austria."
 hungarian_king: "Hungarian King"
 hungarian_king_desc: "King Albert was far too young to lead Hungary into the Great War. His generals, with Field Marshal Horthy at their head, were responsible for this. The teenaged king was forced to watch his armies smash themselves to pieces against the might of the Continental System. Now that the Hungarian Diet's decision to appoint Horthy as Regent has expired, perhaps Hungary can be great once again."
 bomber_harris: "Bomber Harris"

He saw the importance of air power in the Great War during which he achieved the rank of Air Marshal. He became an ally of Edward VIII during the prince's time in the Royal Flying Corps, and was soon drawn into, and disgusted by, the politicking of the government, which he saw as ineffective, weak and decadent."
 revanchist_marshal: "Revanchist Marshal"
 westphalian_king: "Westphalian King"
 westphalian_king_desc: "Frederick II is a descendent of Hieronymus, youngest brother of Napoleon. Westphalia was originally one constituent of a larger Confederation, but a centralised French puppet was easier to manage, and the other kings and dukes were dispossessed soon after the peace of 1817. Westphalia remained a loyal member of the Continental System, but German nationalism demanded special privileges, and the Westphalian kings were allowed to wage limited wars within the French sphere, seizing Saxony from the Wettin kings of Poland, and more recently Schleswig-Holstein from Sweden. The special favour the French Emperor showed to Germany hastened the disintegration of the Continental System, which culminated in the Great War. King Frederick is widely viewed as a weak leader, and the Radicals and ultranationalists used the upheaval as their chance to end French influence in Germany."

 german_tyrant_desc: "Frederick II is a descendent of Hieronymus, youngest brother of Napoleon.

Accusations that the king is a French puppet are considered treasonous."
 life_hussar: "Life Hussar"
 life_hussar_desc: "August von Mackensen was formerly a senior general in the Westphalian army. Born a commoner, he was ennobled by Frederick II's father for his expertise as a cavalry commander. During the Great War, he helped break the trench stalemates with brilliant maneuver warfare, but was relieved of his command for anti-French sentiments. The dismissal of the popular general was a blow to the popularity of the monarchy, and the German ultranationalist movement began coalescing around Mackensen. The rebellion of the Radicals and Democrats gave them their opportunity to strike, and a mass defection of troops ensued. As Reichskanzler, Mackensen demands an end to French influence, annexation of Pomerania, and a return to traditional German values, as embodied by the Teutonic Knights with their Baltic crusades, and the Kingdom of Prussia, heroic enemy of Napoleon."
 huey_long: "Huey Long"
 huey_long_desc: "A populist from the Deep South, Huey Long rose to fame with a campaign promising to make 'every man a king', a dangerous statement in an absolute monarchy. He has a large and loyal following of expansionists, religious extremists and nationalists. As a Governor he acquired a reputation as an authoritarian, deploying local troops to disperse protests and passing many executive orders to circumvent the opposition of the state legislature."
 italian_king: "King of Italy"
 italian_king_desc: "Joachim VI of the French dynasty of Murat is the nominal head of state of Italy. However, his secular power was largely usurped by the dictator Mussolini after the conclusion of the Great War. The House of Murat has waned in popularity over the years, with the public's initial euphoria over unification dampened by continued French possession of Corsica and Piedmont. The ultranationalist elements see the king as a modern day Tarquinius: a corrupt foreigner stymying Italy's growth, and they agitate for the formal removal of King Joachim and the rebirth of a Roman state, but thus far Mussolini has restrained them. Paradoxically, the pretence of the king having power will continue so long as he never attempts to exercise it."
 great_dictator: "Great Dictator"
 great_dictator_desc: "Benito Mussolini began his career in journalism, but moved into politics as a conservative anti-French legislator. He entered the Italian cabinet shortly prior to the Great War and became the face of the propaganda efforts of the Italian war ministry. His Francophobia and revanchism have combined with his militarism and reactionary worldview to create an admiration for the Roman emperors and Greek dictators, and the movement he has built to support his seizure of power models itself on Classical iconography."
 heavenly_king: "Heavenly King of Great Peace"
 heavenly_king_desc: "Hong Dakai is a patrilineal descendent of the original Heavenly King (and 'Younger Brother of Christ') Hong Xiuquan, whose Millenarian Christian kingdom was created after a long and bloody struggle against the Qing. The final resolution of that conflict was prevented by European interventions, but the status quo cannot continue indefinitely. The Taiping state is strong enough now to seek its own destiny, without fear of the cowardly French or exhausted British. As the living embodiment of Christ on Earth, Hong Dakai demands that the northern Manchu barbarians recognise his divinity."
 rasputin: "Grigori Rasputin"
 black_monk: "The Black Monk"
 black_monk_desc: "Rasputin is the ageing influencer behind the Russian throne. A close friend and confidant to Empress Alexandra after winning her trust by healing her son, he effectively acted as regent for the young Alexander IV after Nicholas II's untimely death at the hands of Jacobin assassins. Although he has deep spiritual authority amongst the peasants, he is despised by the Russian nobility for monopolising influence, by the government ministers and civil service for promoting his incompetent favourites, and by the trades unionists and liberals for seeking to roll back political and social reforms." 
 emperor_russia: "Emperor of All the Russias"
 emperor_russia_desc: "Alexander IV was born in 1904 to the liberal reformer Nicholas II, making him a great grandson of Queen Victoria of England. Although he inherited his father's Anglophilia, he also inherited the royal disease, haemophilia, and the many treatments his increasingly desperate parents attempted culminated in the person of Grigori Rasputin, with his spirit healing and seances. Rasputin became a second father to Alexander IV after Nicholas II was assassinated by Jacobins in 1912, and the liberal reforms of his father became seen by the new Autocrat as capitulations to murderers. Under the influence of the Black Monk, Alexander IV dissolved the Duma and sought to destroy the neighbouring republics carved out of Russia's flanks by Napoleon, but the incompetently led Russian army met disaster and rebellion at the hands of the Balts, Belarusians and Ukrainians."

They lead peasants in activities they perceive as strengthening the Romanov government in Russia. While they see themselves as a bulwark against revolutionaries, they are better known for launching pogroms - murdering and terrorising Jews in rural areas and small towns where the liberals and socialists are weak.
