 deluge_france.1.t:0 "May Day"
 deluge_france.1.d:0 "The first of May has been a day of solidarity for labour movements around the world since 1851, when an unruly mob of striking Parisian textile workers were justly brought to order by gendarmes. It has also been a day of apprehension for the ruling classes since 1866, when strikes turned to revolution and kings fled from their palaces in fear. No sovereign wishes to see a return to those chaotic days, so the Paris parade was heavily vetted and controlled by police. We pray there will be no disturbances.\n\nBut we cannot pray forever, changes are needed right now. Society is feverish from the ongoing crisis of financial collapse, when the money bubble burst and destroyed the country's stock exchanges with a flood. France needs to be saved, but before we start updating the economy, we need to dot the "I's" and cross the "T's." in our government apparatus. There are some ambitious and determined people who offer their ideas for changing the situation in exchange for some concessions."
 deluge_france.1.a:0 "It can't be that bad..."
 deluge_france.2.t:0 "French May Day Passes Uneventfully"
 deluge_france.2.d:0 "The ruling classes of the world have breathed a sigh of relief today, as the tension surrounding the Paris parades dissipates under the rays of the new dawn. While the flames of revolution may still be roaring in Germany, the French masses are apparently too subdued by the recent horrors of the Great War to make trouble.\n\nAt least, for now, because the French economy remains crushed after the recent financial collapse and no one can predict how the popular unrest will end."
 deluge_france.2.a:0 "Eternal solidarity!"
 deluge_france.2.b:0 "A troubling time."
 deluge_france.2.c:0 "It was a time of great evil."
 deluge_france.2.e:0 "We must remain vigilant for traitors."
 deluge_france3title: "France Seeks to Punish Britain"
 deluge_france3desccommunism: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that the British policy of international revolution will end immediately. The aggression shown by the British republicans is beyond alarming, it has caused outrage in [From.GetNameDef]. The British republic will soon see the might of the Continental System arrayed against her."
 deluge_france3descdemocratic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued a statement condemning the actions of the British state. [From.GetLeader] is believed to be gathering support for a declaration of war, and fleets are already putting to sea to resolve the disputes between the two nations. For the second time in living memory, the English Channel will once again become a battlefield."
 deluge_france3descneutrality: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that British imperialism must be contained once again. [From.GetNameDefCap] smashed Perfidious Albion in the Napoleonic Wars and the Great War, and the public believe they can win again. The British king is unlikely to get away with the relatively mild terms of Versailles this time around."
 deluge_france3descfascism: "The mounting expansionism shown by the British Empire has alarmed the government of [From.GetNameDef], to the point that [From.GetLeader] considers war the only suitable response. The many nations the British seek to subjugate will no doubt be relieved that the Continental System is finally being brought to bear against the British ultranationalists."
 deluge_france3opta: "Perfidious Albion!"
 deluge_france3optb: "The croaking of frogs doesn't scare us."
 deluge_france3optc: "Concerning news."
 deluge_france4title: "France Seeks to Punish Poland"
 deluge_france4desccommunism: "[From.GetLeader] has condemned the Polish revolutionaries as deluded thieves and murderers. The full military force of [From.GetNameDef] is believed to be mobilising against the Polish republic. The old Wettin kings of Poland failed to resist the Continental System - will the republic fare any better?"
 deluge_france4descdemocratic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] appears to be mobilising her forces against the Polish state. [From.GetLeader] has decried the threat to European stability posed by Poland, and demands the immediate withdrawal of Polish troops from all contested territories. It does not seem likely that Poland will comply."
 deluge_france4descneutrality: "The empire building of the Polish kingdom has drawn the ire of [From.GetLeader]. Declaring that the balance of power has been shifted irrevecably, the government of [From.GetNameDef] seems to be mobilising her armies to invade Poland in a re-enactment of the Great War. But with modern tanks and aircraft, will the outcome be different this time?"
 deluge_france4descfascism: "[From.GetLeader] has declared that the Polish ultranationalists are an enemy of peaceful European civilisation and has demanded the immediate demobilisation of the Polish armed forces. As compliance with the demand seems incredibly unlikely, [From.GetNameDef] also appears to be mobilising for war against Poland."
 deluge_france4opta: "We smashed Poland once, we will do it again."
 deluge_france4optb: "This time, we will win."
 deluge_france4optc: "Concerning news indeed."
 deluge_france5title: "France Seeks to Punish Russia"
 deluge_france5desccommunism: "The revolutionary Russian government has been condemned in the harshest of terms by [From.GetLeader]. Stating that the republicans are committing heinous crimes against civilisation, [From.GetLeader] has appealed to the public of [From.GetNameDef] for a crusade against the Russian radicals, and the armed forces are mobilising."
 deluge_france5descdemocratic: "[From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising for a war against the Russians. Denying the Russian rhetoric of bringing peace and democracy to her troubled neighbours, [From.GetLeader] states that Russia is a menace that must be brought to order. The armed forces are mobilising for what looks to be a terrifying conflict."
 deluge_france5descneutrality: "The imperialism of the Russians has been condemned by the government of [From.GetNameDef]. [From.GetLeader] states that the Russian tsar must abdicate immediately for the good of European stability. This does not seem likely to happen, so the [From.GetAdjective] armed forces are also mobilising for war."
 deluge_france5descfascism: "[From.GetLeader] has been gathering support over the last few months for intervention against the ultranationalists in Russia. Stating that [From.GetNameDef] has a duty to preserve European stability from Russian tyranny, the [From.GetAdjective] armed forces have been called up and war between the two titans seems imminent."
 deluge_france5opta: "General Winter will not save you!"
 deluge_france5optb: "Come, throw yourselves at our defences."
 deluge_france5optc: "Troubling."
 deluge_france6title: "France Seeks to Punish Japan"
 deluge_france6desccommunism: "The Japanese radical movement has been the focus of angry rhetoric from the [From.GetAdjective] government recently. [From.GetLeader] seems to believe that war between [From.GetNameDef] and the Japan republic is inevitable, and is ordering the armed forces to mobilise and the fleets to be made ready."
 deluge_france6descdemocratic: "[From.GetLeader] has stated that the Japanese are exceeding the limits of [From.GetAdjective] patience. [From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her armed forces, and look set to wage a total war against Japan. The [From.GetAdjective] public have been told that the Japanese are warmongers seizing colonies at will, and the public seems eager to destroy this threat to European hegemony."
 deluge_france6descneutrality: "The Japanese empire has been the target of [From.GetAdjective] war propaganda of late. [From.GetLeader] declares that the Japanese are expanding too quickly at the expense of the European empires, and that Hirohito must be punished for his transgressions. [From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her armed forces."
 deluge_france6descfascism: "Militaristic propaganda in [From.GetNameDef] paints the Japanese ultranationalist movement as a gang of subhuman murderers and tyrants. [From.GetLeader] no doubt wishes to justify intervening militarily against the Japanese state, and the public of [From.GetNameDef] seems eager to support such a war. [From.GetAdjective] warships are putting to sea and troops are amassing."
 deluge_france6opta: "Upstart Japs will learn not to cross us."
 deluge_france6optb: "Europe is in decline, Japan is ascendent."
 deluge_france6optc: "Very concerning."
 deluge_france7title: "France Seeks to Punish America"
 deluge_france7desccommunism: "The American experiment in democracy has infuriated [From.GetLeader]. The world order created by Napoleon I is being overturned and [From.GetNameDef]'s position is threatened. The young American republic may now face her former ally in the field of battle. [From.GetAdjective] fleets are even now steaming from ports to contest dominance of the Atlantic sealanes."
 deluge_france7descdemocratic: "Recent American expansionism is threatening [From.GetNameDef]'s position of dominance in the world. [From.GetLeader] has declared that the American state must be contained before she spreads further and becomes too large a rival for the European empires to contest. It seems likely that the two powers will clash soon on the field of battle."
 deluge_france7descneutrality: "The American king has sought to expand at the expense of America's neighbours, and this expansionism has not been ignored by [From.GetLeader]. [From.GetAdjective] fleets are steaming from ports to contest the sealanes of the Atlantic. It seems that [From.GetNameDef] will soon be locked in a titanic clash with the Kingdom of America."
 deluge_france7descfascism: "The ultranationalists in America have sought to expand at the expense of America's neighbours, and this expansionism has not been ignored by [From.GetLeader]. Appealing to the [From.GetAdjective] people to unite against the Yankee threat, [From.GetLeader] has declared that [From.GetNameDef] will not rest until American tyranny is defeated."
 deluge_france7opta: "The New World will never rival France's glory."
 deluge_france7optb: "The Old World is decrepit and doomed to die."
 deluge_france7optc: "Very concerning news."
 deluge_france8title: "France Seeks to Punish Turkey"
 deluge_france8desccommunism: "The Turkish republic has garnered the ire of [From.GetLeader] after recent expansionism upset the balance of power in the Middle East and the Balkans. [From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her troops to contest the field of battle with the Turkish radicals. The former allies look set to become deadly enemies."
 deluge_france8descdemocratic: "The Turkish state has garnered the ire of [From.GetLeader] after recent expansionism upset the balance of power in the Middle East and the Balkans. [From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her troops to contest the field of battle with the Ottoman forces. The former allies look set to become deadly enemies."
 deluge_france8descneutrality: "The Ottoman Empire has garnered the ire of [From.GetLeader] after recent expansionism upset the balance of power in the Middle East and the Balkans. [From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her troops to contest the field of battle with the Caliph's forces. The former allies look set to become deadly enemies."
 deluge_france8descfascism: "The Ottoman Caliphate has garnered the ire of [From.GetLeader] after recent expansionism upset the balance of power in the Middle East and the Balkans. [From.GetNameDefCap] is mobilising her troops to contest the field of battle with the Turkish ultranationalists. The former allies look set to become deadly enemies."

 deluge_france8optc: "Troubling news."
 deluge_france9title: "France Seeks to Punish Austria"
 deluge_france9desccommunism: "The Socialist Republic of Austria has drawn the attention of the government of [From.GetNameDef] after recent expansionism. [From.GetLeader] has declared that the Austrian radicals will never threaten European stability again and [From.GetAdjective] troops are even now mobilising for battle. It seems that the shared suffering of the Great War allies did not bring the nations together, but has set the stage for yet another bloody conflict."
 deluge_france9descdemocratic: "The Federal Republic of Austria has drawn the attention of the government of [From.GetNameDef] after recent expansionism. [From.GetLeader] has declared that the Austrian government will never threaten European stability again and [From.GetAdjective] troops are even now mobilising for battle. It seems that the shared suffering of the Great War allies did not bring the nations together, but has set the stage for yet another bloody conflict."
 deluge_france9descneutrality: "The Austrian Empire has drawn the attention of the government of [From.GetNameDef] after recent expansionism. [From.GetLeader] has declared that the Habsburg Monarchy will never threaten European stability again and [From.GetAdjective] troops are even now mobilising for battle. It seems that the shared suffering of the Great War allies did not bring the nations together, but has set the stage for yet another bloody conflict."

 deluge_france10title: "May Day, 1937"
 deluge_france10desc: "Today has seen one of the largest parades in living memory, even larger than the 1936 May Day march. The devastating post-war economic adjustment has left millions of Frenchmen out of work, and they are marching in the streets with the trades unionists, socialists and republicans to voice their anger. The huge size of the demonstration was noticed by the entire nation."
 deluge_france10opt: "Keep an eye on these malcontents."
 deluge_france11title: "May Day, 1937"
 deluge_france11desc: "The socialists and radicals are parading once again, for 'jobs, equality and peace'. The Jacobins have a large audience to spread their dangerous ideals to thanks to the troubled times we find ourselves in. Perhaps a million Frenchmen have taken to the streets in the largest demonstration in living memory. Anti-war sentiments are strong and we should be on the alert for agitators in the crowds."
 deluge_france11opt: "Send in the gendarmes to crack some skulls."
 deluge_france12title: "May Day, 1937"
 deluge_france12desc: "The socialists and Jacobins have taken to the streets, alongside upwards of a million unemployed Frenchmen angry at the government's economic policies. The largest demonstration in living memory has coalesced to support the German Communists we have been suppressing. Reports on the ground indicate outright treason is brewing, with police stations in several cities besieged by rioting mobs. The situation is incredibly dangerous for our government."
 deluge_france12opt: "Nothing a few rifle volleys can't solve."
 deluge_france13title: "May Day, 1938"
 deluge_france13desc: "Another year, another ridiculous parade of dirty labourers and angry layabouts to police. With our nation at peace and still suffering the effects of the recent economic downturn, the radicals have a large audience to spread their ideas, but not much opportunity to act on them. Unemployment remains in the hundreds of thousands, but is decreasing."
 deluge_france13opt: "Things are calming down gradually."
 deluge_france14title: "May Day, 1938"
 deluge_france14desc: "Anti-war demonstrations have been joined by socialist and trades unionist marchers all over France to protest at our government's defence policies. Popular opinion marginally favours the radicals, and their strength should not be underestimated. They are joined by hundreds of thousands of unemployed Frenchmen still suffering from the effects of the post-war adjustment."
 deluge_france14opt: "Send in the gendarmes to crack some skulls."
 deluge_france15title: "May Day, 1938"
 deluge_france15desc: "Our policy of intervention in the German Civil War has drawn the ire of socialists and Jacobins. With hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen still out of work, today's parade has been huge, and the marchers place the blame for their misfortune directly on our 'tyrannical' government. Violent disorder has been reported in several departments, with riots against the government resulting in several dead and hundreds wounded. A firm response is needed to show the troublemakers that we will not tolerate their incitement."
 deluge_france15opt: "Nothing a few rifle volleys can't solve."
 deluge_france16title: "May Day, 1939"
 deluge_france16desc: "The trades unionist marchers had a good turnout today, although decidedly lower than that of the past few years. It seems that the improved economy and long period of peace have together undermined many of the arguments of the leftists. Capitalism is no longer on the brink of collapse, and the government is winning back some of the popularity it lost during the Great War. While the socialists will likely continue their marches in future, the monarchy seems to be safe from revolution."
 deluge_france16opt: "The crisis is finally over."
 deluge_france17title: "May Day, 1939"
 deluge_france17desc: "Debates over opposition to the war dominated the trades unionist marchers today. The stronger economy has reduced unemployment and the 'warmongering' of the government is now the primary target of the radical opposition. While the leftists are an immediate threat, the light at the end of the tunnel is visible: if we manage to keep these demonstrations orderly, this should be the last major march for some time."
 deluge_france17opt: "Send in the gendarmes to crack some skulls."
 deluge_france18title: "May Day, 1939"
 deluge_france18desc: "The booming economy has put to rest many of the radical arguments for deposing the monarchy, but our intervention in the German Civil War continues to infuriate them. Sporadic violence is reported in many cities, with policemen being attacked and government property vandalised. Still, unemployment is now very low, and if we can put this disorder to rest, we should be free of major obstacles to our rule for the foreseeable future."
 deluge_france18opt: "Nothing a few rifle volleys can't solve."
 deluge_france19title: "Revolution!"
 deluge_france19desc: "While the shots of the gendarmes cleared many bystanders from the streets, rioting continued overnight, and by the next morning had intensified into roving gun battles. Barricades were established in the blood-stained streets near police stations and army barracks, manned by radicals sympathetic to the German Communists. Large numbers of soldiers and sailors have defected, and although loyal security forces in Paris managed to protect the Emperor and the National Assembly, much of the country is now in open war, with the capital of a provisional republican government declared in Limoges."

 deluge_france19optb: "Vive la Révolution!"
 deluge_france20title: "French Civil War"
 deluge_france20desc: "After an extended period of civil unrest culminating in the use of military police to fire on May Day marchers, France has errupted into civil war. The revolutionaries seem to be led by Radical socialists seeking the overthrow of the Bonapartist regime and the creation of a second French Republic, but the situation is very volatile and there are other factions trying to influence the outcome."
 deluge_france20opta: "Do you hear the people sing?"
 deluge_france20optb: "Perhaps the belligerents will settle peacefully."
 deluge_france20optc: "Long live [From.GetLeader]!"

 deluge_france22opt: "Vive la Révolution!"
 deluge_france23title: "France Seeks to Punish Germany"
 deluge_france23desc: "The French have begun to blame Germany for the breakdown of the Continental System and the onset of the Great War, and their concerns seem to have been justified in light of Germany's recent aggressions. Now [From.GetLeader] has declared [From.GetNameDef] will stand for these violations no more, and it is believed France has begun mobilising against the Germans."
 deluge_france23opta: "The fools are upsetting our carefully laid plans!"
 deluge_france23optb: "Germany will be great again."
 deluge_france23optc: "Very worrying."
 deluge_france24title: "Anti-War Demonstration"
 deluge_france24desc: "Our policy of intervention in the German Civil War has drawn the ire of socialists and Jacobins. Today, huge anti-war demonstrations of tens of thousands of people marched through the streets of several major cities including Paris. Violent disorder has been reported in many departments, with riots against the government resulting in dozens dead and hundreds wounded.

This significant development marks a triumph for the Libyan populace and underscores the resilience of the Local Senussi Order in the face of adversity.

This noteworthy development signals a success for the French Empire and challenges the perceived resilience of the Local Senussi Order in the face of adversity.
