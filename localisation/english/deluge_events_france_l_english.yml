 deluge_france.1.t:0 "May Day"
 deluge_france.1.d:0 "The first of May has been a day of solidarity for labour movements around the world since 1851, when an unruly mob of striking Parisian textile workers were justly brought to order by gendarmes. It has also been a day of apprehension for the ruling classes since 1866, when strikes turned to revolution and kings fled from their palaces in fear. No sovereign wishes to see a return to those chaotic days, so the Paris parade was heavily vetted and controlled by police. We pray there will be no disturbances.\n\nBut we cannot pray forever, changes are needed right now. Society is feverish from the ongoing crisis of financial collapse, when the money bubble burst and destroyed the country's stock exchanges with a flood. France needs to be saved, but before we start updating the economy, we need to dot the "I's" and cross the "T's." in our government apparatus. There are some ambitious and determined people who offer their ideas for changing the situation in exchange for some concessions."

 deluge_france.2.d:0 "The ruling classes of the world have breathed a sigh of relief today, as the tension surrounding the Paris parades dissipates under the rays of the new dawn. While the flames of revolution may still be roaring in Germany, the French masses are apparently too subdued by the recent horrors of the Great War to make trouble.\n\nAt least, for now, because the French economy remains crushed after the recent financial collapse and no one can predict how the popular unrest will end."

 deluge_france.4.t:0 "Boulangists Coup!"
 deluge_france.4.d:0 "In order to gain absolute power, the emperor proposed the cooperation of some former members of the French Action, such as Henri Vaugeois, who did not run away to support Louisiana after the Great War. Today, his efforts have culminated in the introduction of reforms that effectively remove any government role in state affairs, turning it into more of a council designed solely to advise the emperor.\n\nHowever, despite gaining absolute power, one more obstacle appeared in the emperor's way - a military coup! Today, high-ranking military men calling themselves Bulangists entered the emperor's palace and want to force him to hand over power to them by force of firearms.\n\nThe Bulangists are a group of military men with extreme right-wing and revanchist views. They were inspired by Georges Ernest Boulanger, the Minister of War, who took this office after 1866, when riots broke out in the country, the central government and the army were distracted from their duties, thanks to which the Netherlands and Italy were able to win their independence with the help of the British. At the same time, Spain tried to become independent from our empire, but despite the indirect support of Louisiana it failed. Bulangists strive for a revanchist foreign policy, aimed at restoring France's position as the European hegemon and then taking over the rest of the world. In addition, they want to restore the agrarian lifestyle, deal with minorities, full patriarchy and militarization of the state.\n\nThe main commanders of the coup are Louis Franchet d’Espérey and Maxime Weygand. In this situation, the emperor has no choice but to try to convince them that he will pursue their revanchist ideas. If he fails he will become their puppet."

 deluge_france.5.d2:0 "Current leader of Boulangists is Louis Franchet d'Espérey, however, after a wave of layoffs aimed at modernizing the high command, his position is being questioned. No other person from the most senior military ranks has both the support and competence to take over the leadership. Maxime Weygand was considered, but he too lost support and influence after losing his position. The last option left is the founder of the Cowl, Eugène Deloncle. He is also a known terrorist wanted by our country for a long time, but now not only has he been acquitted, but he has also gained support for his extremism. What is certain is that he will take over now that d'Espérey is too old, too uninfluential and too unpopular."

 deluge_france.6.t:0 "Coup d'Etat"
 deluge_france.6.d:0 "Today, an association of anti-monarchist military men, mainly generals and marshals, and a few politicians broke into the Louvre, killing the Emperor's most loyal guards. Their goal is to end political chaos by dealing with the imperial family and the French monarchy itself. They are led by Maurice Gamelin, a Republican marshal. He is helped by Maxime Weygand and Louis Franchet d'Espérey, the right-wing marshals, right-wing socialist activist Marcel Déat and the far-left leaders Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos. The defenseless imperial family and the emperor himself are at their mercy. This group must collectively decide what to do with the imperial family."

 deluge_france.7.t:0 "First Days of the Republic..."
 deluge_france.7.d:0 "After the issue of the imperial family was resolved, France became an official republic. It is led by a group led by Maurice Gamelin. It is full of internal disputes and its existence will not last long. Their headquarters is the Louvre, where various conspiracies are being hatched in various corners of the palace. Gamelin's plan is to invite the leaders of the democratic opposition such as Paul Reynaud and Édouard Daladier to the Louvre for talks regarding the new political system in France. Moreover, he plans to slowly de-escalate the riots using both the police and promises from left-wing and right-wing politicians. However, whispers say that Maxime Weygand intends to contact various nationalist groups from all over the country, Louis Franchet d'Espérey plans to convince the army, and Marcel Déat - plans to convince the workers. Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos also plan to sneak out of the palace and start inciting the people against the rest of the coalition members. However, these are only whispers and Gamelin will decide for himself whether he will order the palace closed and, in practice, sentence everyone except himself to "house arrest"."

 deluge_france.8.t:0 "Democratic Reform"
 deluge_france.8.d:0 "Seeing the problems of the current system and the people's pressure for self-determination, the Emperor decided that the best solution for France and its empire would be to transform France into a constitutional monarchy, where the Emperor plays a role similar to the president in other systems: he will have partial executive power, he will be able to veto laws, and will also have other rights and obligations.\n\nConverting to such a system is, according to some, a poor compromise because nobility titles will be retained and the nobility and capitalists will still constitute a significant force in the system. However, according to the Emperor, such people are extreme Radicals who would like to overthrow the monarchy itself. For this reason the list of parties will initially be limited, the three main ones are:\nDemocratic Republican Alliance - a centrist party striving for a golden mean, rejecting both the ideals of revolution and reactionism,\nRadical Party - a left-wing party, despite its name, it cannot be fully ideologically called radical, because its current composition is social democrats and social liberals,\nPopular Republican Movement - a right-wing, conservative party based on the principles of Christian democracy.\n\nToday the first elections are held and the vote belongs to the people..."

Édouard Daladier is a former Minister of Defense and soldier during the Great War. Albert Sarraut is a former two-time Governor General of French Indochina.

 deluge_france.11.t:0 "Chaos in Paris"
 deluge_france.11.d:0 "Chaos reigned in Paris. Most people, including the army and the police, stopped listening to the government and took to the streets to protest. Extremely ideological militias took advantage of the opportunity and began to operate in broad daylight, just like many thieves and other criminals who go unpunished due to their lack of enforcement of the law. Apparently, some extreme groups have set up guillotines in their controlled territories and are committing lynchings on ordinary citizens for acts that the executioners consider incorrect. Many believe that current events are the second Great French Revolution. The imperial family has barricaded itself with its most loyal soldiers in the Louvre, and tourists are fleeing the city. Both foreigners and French people are afraid to enter the city."

 deluge_france.12.t:0 "The pressure is rising..."
 deluge_france.12.d:0 "Rumors about the plans of the extreme right and the extreme left in the coalition turned out to be true. When Maurice Gamelin invited Paul Reynaud, Édouard Daladier and Albert Sarraut to the Louvre for talks, some people slipped out of the palace. Maurice Thorez calls for a proletarian revolution in the Place de la Concorde, while Jacques Duclos calls for the same in front of the Hôtel des Invalides. Meanwhile, Louis Franchet d'Espérey is organizing troops on the Champ de Mars, Maxime Weygand is preparing radio equipment on the Eiffel Tower, and Marcel Déat is gaining the support of conservative workers on Île de la Cité. The pressure in Paris is growing as all political groups prepare their forces to fight for power over the newly established republic.\n\nOne of the first decisions of radicals is who to focus their attention on - Maurice Gamelin or the right. They both could pose a serious threat, and this decision could have serious consequences."
 deluge_france.12.a:0 "Radicals should focus on Gamelin."
 deluge_france.12.b:0 "Radicals should focus on the right."
 deluge_france.13.t:0 "Dawn of Democracy..."
 deluge_france.13.d:0 "After Maurice Gamelin closed down and thus disabled the rest of the coalition in the Louvre, he contacted the so-called "Party of Movement" - a union of many different democratic parties. They managed to agree on the system of the new republic as a parliamentary republic. Following this announcement, as well as the actions of the police and politicians, protests in Paris are slowly decreasing and preparations for the formation of a parliament have begun. The most extremist activists were arrested and sentenced to prison, and many people were given amnesty."
 deluge_france.13.a:0 "Peace at last!"
 deluge_france.14.t:0 "Blood instead of water in the Seine..."
 deluge_france.14.d:0 "Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos led the workers who were to neutralize Marshal Gamelin. They broke into the Louvre, where bloody clashes broke out, where a huge number of workers were shot and a large number of soldiers were killed with ordinary factory tools. Finally, Gamelin and his soldiers surrendered, because although his soldiers were very well trained compared to ordinary workers, the forces of radicals were much larger and new ones were constantly arriving. For a few hours they wondered what to do with Gamelin and the captured politicians of the democratic opposition, and also tried to stabilize their power in the Louvre and the surrounding area, while on the other side of the Seine the right wing was finishing its plans. D'Espérey prepared his army and advanced on the Louvre and its gardens from the south through the Pont de la Concorde. Marcel Déat attacked with his workers from the east, and Maxime Weygand made a radio speech throughout France urging all nationalist movements to come to Paris to "destroy the Jewish-radical threat."\n\nThe French Popular Party led by Jacques Doriot marched from their headquarters in Bordeaux, the French Social Party led by Colonel François de La Rocque from Dunkirk and Lille, and the Francist Movement set off from Marseille led by Marcel Bucard. They moved around on horses, bicycles and cars. Most of the time, the police didn't stop them because they didn't break the law and they didn't know who to listen to - the central government in Paris collapsed and they waited for the chaos to end. When all parties and their militias reached Paris, they found a bloody massacre where workers supporting the radicals murdered each other along with soldiers, police and workers supporting the right wing. When militias from all over France entered the city, Fire Movement led by Maurice Delaunay emerged from the underground of Paris and joined them. Maxime Weygand and D'Espérey thought these nationalists were their allies, but they too turned against them. A total massacre ensued, in which a huge mass of workers and public officials died at the hands of fanatical and mad nationalists. D'Espérey was captured, and Maxime reached an agreement with the leaders of these organizations. He knows that he will not be able to take power, and the only thing he can do is ensure the safety of himself and his most loyal supporters, as well as influence who exactly will take power. Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos fled without a trace, and Marcel Déat became an influential figure in the nationalist coalition. Now it will be time to choose the final leader of France, but everyone hopes that despite the extremism in the air, it will happen without bloodshed."

 deluge_france.15.t:0 "Workers' Triumph"
 deluge_france.15.d:0 "Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos led the workers towards the Champ de Mars and the Eiffle Tower. Along the way, they benefited from the help of The French Section of the Workers' International, anarchists and Georges Valois' national radicals. They all arrived at the site together and pacified d'Espérey's unprepared troops. Mostly there was no fight, the soldiers were taken by surprise and capitulated. All were taken prisoner. The Eiffle Tower was surrounded and Maxime Weygand and his men defended until they ran out of resources. After that they were captured. Marcel Déat was neutralized because his workers abandoned him, seeing the forces of radicals and hearing in some respects the right-wing rhetoric of Valois. They then set out for the Louvre, which they surrounded. Gamelin, seeing this, decided to negotiate and resolved the conflict peacefully, thus ending the fighting in Paris.\n\nMaurice Thorez sees that the French Communist Party is not the dominant force among radicals. When choosing a ruling party and leaders, they will have to make many political maneuvers and also convince the people of France..."

 deluge_france_lore.1.t:0 "Inspection in the Army"
 deluge_france_lore.1.d:0 "The French army is an icon of undisputed power. With many divisions around the world, it’s a major force on the international stage.\n\nHowever, our army is lagging behind. Our soldiers use obsolete equipment such as rifles from the interwar period, and the organization of our armored vehicles is based on flags, not on-board radios. Finally, our army acts without coordinating with the other military branches.  Pride seems to have replaced competence and organization, we can no longer tolerate this: the world is changing, and our army must evolve.\n\nFaced with such a bleak situation, a number of officers are trying to improve our doctrines and equipment. Colonel De Gaulle, for example, believes that the judicious use of armor represents the future of modern warfare. We can also mention Captain Sauvagnac, a theorist who established several tactics on the use of paratrooper infantry. Unfortunately, all these innovative initiatives are often slowed down or even sidelined by arrogant high-ranking officers comforted by our past victories.\n\nReforming the army will not be an easy task, and judicious choices will have to be made if we want to face up to the challenge."
 deluge_france_lore.1.a:0 "Understood!"
 deluge_france_lore.2.t:0 "The MAS 36"
 deluge_france_lore.2.d:0 "The first step to modernize our army is to renew the soldier's individual equipment, and in particular his rifle: Lebel, Berthier and RSC have been issued during the Great War and even before! These rifles are now obsolete for the coming fights due to their bulky and outdated designs. Following conclusive trials, the Saint-Étienne weapons factory (MAS) has just received a major order for a new design: the MAS 36.\n\nDesigned to be robust and easy to maintain, the manufacturing process is also greatly simplified, making the MAS 36 an excellent rifle in many aspects. A pre-production batch of 5,000 units has been delivered, and production may start during the coming days."

 deluge_france_lore.3.d:0 "The very first warrior was an infantryman. In France, the real infantry dates back to Louis XI. Progress and development of weapons, motorization and radio transformed its face. Now, infantry could be backed up at all times by other arms. But the strength of the infantry is the Man. The Man, who alone, can fight permanently no matter the conditions, by day or by night, in the mountains, forests, towns, whatever the climate. The Man always passes, even where the vehicle cannot. \n\nToday, infantry can be deployed with armored vehicles and even tanks. None of the techniques used in modern combat are foreign to it. The infantryman remains the warrior of the last 300 meters, despite the development of war machines. It's his mission to face his adversary, man or tank, in close combat."

 deluge_france_lore.4.t:0 "The Atlantic Line"
 deluge_france_lore.4.d:0 "The biggest failure of the French army during the Great War was its inability to prevent the British landing at Calais and occupying the city. Lacking sufficient resources, the French soldiers were surprised by the British amphibious offensive, and were forced to retreat inland. To stem any future invasion from the English Channel, we should fortify our coasts. A parallel proposal to the Maginot Line, the Atlantic Line would be a series of fortifications and coastal batteries stretching from Brittany to the Dutch coast. This monumental project would have to be carried out in several stages, but once completed, it would allow us to secure our coasts."
 deluge_france_lore.4.a:0 "Better safe than sorry."
 deluge_france_lore.5.t:0 "The Maginot Line"
 deluge_france_lore.5.d:0 "Conceived by Minister André Maginot, the Maginot Line is a series of fortifications built on the French-Italian border. The mountainous terrain of the Alps means the defense is easier, making it more difficult for an army to advance. The sites of this Alpine line are designed to lock passage points, such as passes and valley outlets. As a symbol of French engineering, the Maginot Line would be a major asset to prevent any invasion through the Alps. However, the line is bound to be breached, as it cannot be completely sealed, and the anti-aircraft defense is weak. We should keep this in mind and remedy it, or at least provide air cover for our soldiers stationed in this strategic position."
 deluge_france_lore.5.a:0 "Better safe than sorry."
 deluge_france_lore.6.t:0 "Barrages David"
 deluge_france_lore.6.d:0 "Air warfare has come a long way since the Great War, as have anti-aircraft defenses and advanced detection of enemy aircraft. Commissioned by the Air Force, studies in this direction have been carried out since 1928 by Pierre David, an engineer from Limoges. A viable prototype was built, enabling the position of aircraft to be visualized by electromagnetic detection as they passed between a transmitter and a receiver.\n\nThe demonstration was convincing, and the military would like to acquire these systems. Installed along our borders and coasts, such systems would detect the approach of enemy aircraft formations before they could penetrate our airspace, and allow our fighters to take off and intercept the enemy, canceling its surprise effect. We should consider investing funds in this program, in order to finalize the design and make the system operational."

 deluge_france_lore.7.d:0 "The General Purpose Vehicle, nicknamed "Jeep" by our American friends, is a surprisingly small off-road vehicle. Initially built on a very limited scale, it didn't take long before every branch of the US military was requesting hundreds of them. Recently, our soldiers had the opportunity to drive this famous Jeep: its off-road performances and handling are unbelievable! It's fast, sturdy, easy to disassemble and so light that it can easily be loaded into a landing craft or even a DC-3-sized transport aircraft! The impression was so good, that field marshal de Lattre reportedly wrote and urged André Maginot to negotiate a licensed production.\n\nAfter some diplomatic moves, Hotchkiss executives were able to approach Ford. A visit to American factories followed, and an agreement was reached for us to produce our own Jeeps. A plant is already under construction near Paris, and the vehicles produced will be delivered as soon as possible."

 deluge_france_lore.8.t:0 "Review the Fleet"
 deluge_france_lore.8.d:0 "Affectionately nicknamed La Royale by the military, our navy is one of the most powerful. It operates a wide range of ships, from the imposing battleships of the Great War to agile destroyers. However, the British landing at Calais of 1919 seriously undermined the navy's prestige and put a question mark over its performance.. Add to this the fact that our ships, for all their power, are equipped with outdated systems. Worse still, numerous naval intelligence reports suggest that the Royal Navy and the Japanese Navy are modernizing their ships. These countries operate on the outskirts of our naval zones of influence and colonies, this situation is serious. France naval supremacy is under threat, and we need to modernize our fleet!\n\nOur navy also operates a number of aircraft and seaplanes that are becoming obsolete. It would be wise to study new designs to replace them in the near future for our coastal surveillance needs. Experts also believe that naval aviation could play a major role in future confrontations - a theory refuted by supporters of battleships, obviously.\n\nFinally, some officers suggested the creation of a naval infantry corps and the study of landing tactics. Such maneuvers already proved their worth during the Great War, when the American Royal Marines distinguished themselves in battle.\n\nTime goes by and naval warfare is changing, and we have to adapt if we want to preserve our naval supremacy. We cannot allow ourselves to lag behind!"

 deluge_france_lore.9.d:0 "After several trials, our scientists have developed a new “disruptive” camouflage for the navy. This camouflage featuring variable geometric shapes was developed to disrupt the targeting of a ship by a submarine: the geometric shapes break up the profile of the ship, making the evaluation of trajectory taken by the submarine crew more difficult to get.\n\nThe first camouflages of this kind were developed during the Great War and used by the British and Americans with varying degrees of success. A similar project was launched in France, but as the conflict ended in our favor, dedicated funds were cut. Now, more than ever, we need to defend ourselves against submarines."
