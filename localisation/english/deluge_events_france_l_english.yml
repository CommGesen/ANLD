 deluge_france.1.t:0 "May Day"
 deluge_france.1.d:0 "The first of May has been a day of solidarity for labour movements around the world since 1851, when an unruly mob of striking Parisian textile workers were justly brought to order by gendarmes. It has also been a day of apprehension for the ruling classes since 1866, when strikes turned to revolution and kings fled from their palaces in fear. No sovereign wishes to see a return to those chaotic days, so the Paris parade was heavily vetted and controlled by police. We pray there will be no disturbances.\n\nBut we cannot pray forever, changes are needed right now. Society is feverish from the ongoing crisis of financial collapse, when the money bubble burst and destroyed the country's stock exchanges with a flood. France needs to be saved, but before we start updating the economy, we need to dot the "I's" and cross the "T's." in our government apparatus. There are some ambitious and determined people who offer their ideas for changing the situation in exchange for some concessions."

 deluge_france.2.d:0 "The ruling classes of the world have breathed a sigh of relief today, as the tension surrounding the Paris parades dissipates under the rays of the new dawn. While the flames of revolution may still be roaring in Germany, the French masses are apparently too subdued by the recent horrors of the Great War to make trouble.\n\nAt least, for now, because the French economy remains crushed after the recent financial collapse and no one can predict how the popular unrest will end."

 deluge_france.4.d:0 "In order to gain absolute power, the emperor proposed the cooperation of some former members of the French Action, such as Henri Vaugeois, who did not run away to support Louisiana after the Great War. Today, his efforts have culminated in the introduction of reforms that effectively remove any government role in state affairs, turning it into more of a council designed solely to advise the emperor.\n\nHowever, despite gaining absolute power, one more obstacle appeared in the emperor's way - a military coup! Today, high-ranking military men calling themselves Bulangists entered the emperor's palace and want to force him to hand over power to them by force of firearms.\n\nThe Bulangists are a group of military men with extreme right-wing and revanchist views. They were inspired by Georges Ernest Boulanger, the Minister of War, who took this office after 1866, when riots broke out in the country, the central government and the army were distracted from their duties, thanks to which the Netherlands and Italy were able to win their independence with the help of the British. At the same time, Spain tried to become independent from our empire, but despite the indirect support of Louisiana it failed. Bulangists strive for a revanchist foreign policy, aimed at restoring France's position as the European hegemon and then taking over the rest of the world. In addition, they want to restore the agrarian lifestyle, deal with minorities, full patriarchy and militarization of the state.\n\nThe main commanders of the coup are Louis Franchet d’Espérey and Maxime Weygand. In this situation, the emperor has no choice but to try to convince them that he will pursue their revanchist ideas. If he fails he will become their puppet."

No other person from the most senior military ranks has both the support and competence to take over the leadership. Maxime Weygand was considered, but he too lost support and influence after losing his position. The last option left is the founder of the Cowl, Eugène Deloncle. He is also a known terrorist wanted by our country for a long time, but now not only has he been acquitted, but he has also gained support for his extremism. What is certain is that he will take over now that d'Espérey is too old, too uninfluential and too unpopular."

Their goal is to end political chaos by dealing with the imperial family and the French monarchy itself. They are led by Maurice Gamelin, a Republican marshal. He is helped by Maxime Weygand and Louis Franchet d'Espérey, the right-wing marshals, right-wing socialist activist Marcel Déat and the far-left leaders Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos. The defenseless imperial family and the emperor himself are at their mercy. This group must collectively decide what to do with the imperial family."

It is full of internal disputes and its existence will not last long. Their headquarters is the Louvre, where various conspiracies are being hatched in various corners of the palace. Gamelin's plan is to invite the leaders of the democratic opposition such as Paul Reynaud and Édouard Daladier to the Louvre for talks regarding the new political system in France. Moreover, he plans to slowly de-escalate the riots using both the police and promises from left-wing and right-wing politicians. However, whispers say that Maxime Weygand intends to contact various nationalist groups from all over the country, Louis Franchet d'Espérey plans to convince the army, and Marcel Déat - plans to convince the workers. Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos also plan to sneak out of the palace and start inciting the people against the rest of the coalition members. However, these are only whispers and Gamelin will decide for himself whether he will order the palace closed and, in practice, sentence everyone except himself to "house arrest"."

 deluge_france.8.d:0 "Seeing the problems of the current system and the people's pressure for self-determination, the Emperor decided that the best solution for France and its empire would be to transform France into a constitutional monarchy, where the Emperor plays a role similar to the president in other systems: he will have partial executive power, he will be able to veto laws, and will also have other rights and obligations.\n\nConverting to such a system is, according to some, a poor compromise because nobility titles will be retained and the nobility and capitalists will still constitute a significant force in the system. However, according to the Emperor, such people are extreme Radicals who would like to overthrow the monarchy itself. For this reason the list of parties will initially be limited, the three main ones are:\nDemocratic Republican Alliance - a centrist party striving for a golden mean, rejecting both the ideals of revolution and reactionism,\nRadical Party - a left-wing party, despite its name, it cannot be fully ideologically called radical, because its current composition is social democrats and social liberals,\nPopular Republican Movement - a right-wing, conservative party based on the principles of Christian democracy.\n\nToday the first elections are held and the vote belongs to the people..."

 deluge_france.11.d:0 "Chaos reigned in Paris. Most people, including the army and the police, stopped listening to the government and took to the streets to protest. Extremely ideological militias took advantage of the opportunity and began to operate in broad daylight, just like many thieves and other criminals who go unpunished due to their lack of enforcement of the law. Apparently, some extreme groups have set up guillotines in their controlled territories and are committing lynchings on ordinary citizens for acts that the executioners consider incorrect. Many believe that current events are the second Great French Revolution. The imperial family has barricaded itself with its most loyal soldiers in the Louvre, and tourists are fleeing the city. Both foreigners and French people are afraid to enter the city."

When Maurice Gamelin invited Paul Reynaud, Édouard Daladier and Albert Sarraut to the Louvre for talks, some people slipped out of the palace. Maurice Thorez calls for a proletarian revolution in the Place de la Concorde, while Jacques Duclos calls for the same in front of the Hôtel des Invalides. Meanwhile, Louis Franchet d'Espérey is organizing troops on the Champ de Mars, Maxime Weygand is preparing radio equipment on the Eiffel Tower, and Marcel Déat is gaining the support of conservative workers on Île de la Cité. The pressure in Paris is growing as all political groups prepare their forces to fight for power over the newly established republic.\n\nOne of the first decisions of radicals is who to focus their attention on - Maurice Gamelin or the right. They both could pose a serious threat, and this decision could have serious consequences."

 deluge_france.13.d:0 "After Maurice Gamelin closed down and thus disabled the rest of the coalition in the Louvre, he contacted the so-called "Party of Movement" - a union of many different democratic parties. They managed to agree on the system of the new republic as a parliamentary republic. Following this announcement, as well as the actions of the police and politicians, protests in Paris are slowly decreasing and preparations for the formation of a parliament have begun. The most extremist activists were arrested and sentenced to prison, and many people were given amnesty."

 deluge_france.14.t:0 "Blood instead of water in the Seine..."
 deluge_france.14.d:0 "Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos led the workers who were to neutralize Marshal Gamelin. They broke into the Louvre, where bloody clashes broke out, where a huge number of workers were shot and a large number of soldiers were killed with ordinary factory tools. Finally, Gamelin and his soldiers surrendered, because although his soldiers were very well trained compared to ordinary workers, the forces of radicals were much larger and new ones were constantly arriving. For a few hours they wondered what to do with Gamelin and the captured politicians of the democratic opposition, and also tried to stabilize their power in the Louvre and the surrounding area, while on the other side of the Seine the right wing was finishing its plans. D'Espérey prepared his army and advanced on the Louvre and its gardens from the south through the Pont de la Concorde. Marcel Déat attacked with his workers from the east, and Maxime Weygand made a radio speech throughout France urging all nationalist movements to come to Paris to "destroy the Jewish-radical threat."\n\nThe French Popular Party led by Jacques Doriot marched from their headquarters in Bordeaux, the French Social Party led by Colonel François de La Rocque from Dunkirk and Lille, and the Francist Movement set off from Marseille led by Marcel Bucard. They moved around on horses, bicycles and cars. Most of the time, the police didn't stop them because they didn't break the law and they didn't know who to listen to - the central government in Paris collapsed and they waited for the chaos to end. When all parties and their militias reached Paris, they found a bloody massacre where workers supporting the radicals murdered each other along with soldiers, police and workers supporting the right wing. When militias from all over France entered the city, Fire Movement led by Maurice Delaunay emerged from the underground of Paris and joined them. Maxime Weygand and D'Espérey thought these nationalists were their allies, but they too turned against them. A total massacre ensued, in which a huge mass of workers and public officials died at the hands of fanatical and mad nationalists. D'Espérey was captured, and Maxime reached an agreement with the leaders of these organizations. He knows that he will not be able to take power, and the only thing he can do is ensure the safety of himself and his most loyal supporters, as well as influence who exactly will take power. Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos fled without a trace, and Marcel Déat became an influential figure in the nationalist coalition. Now it will be time to choose the final leader of France, but everyone hopes that despite the extremism in the air, it will happen without bloodshed."

Along the way, they benefited from the help of The French Section of the Workers' International, anarchists and Georges Valois' national radicals. They all arrived at the site together and pacified d'Espérey's unprepared troops. Mostly there was no fight, the soldiers were taken by surprise and capitulated. All were taken prisoner. The Eiffle Tower was surrounded and Maxime Weygand and his men defended until they ran out of resources. After that they were captured. Marcel Déat was neutralized because his workers abandoned him, seeing the forces of radicals and hearing in some respects the right-wing rhetoric of Valois. They then set out for the Louvre, which they surrounded. Gamelin, seeing this, decided to negotiate and resolved the conflict peacefully, thus ending the fighting in Paris.\n\nMaurice Thorez sees that the French Communist Party is not the dominant force among radicals. When choosing a ruling party and leaders, they will have to make many political maneuvers and also convince the people of France..."

 deluge_france.17.t:0 "New Leader of France"
 deluge_france.17.d:0 "After all ultra-nationalists from country united in Paris and stabilized the situation, this association of various nationalists must choose the leader of France. The force that allows each of them to maintain itself is the people opposed to both left-wing radicals, nepotistic monarchists and corrupt democrats. Many people do not have a specific favorite. Therefore, it was decided to hold elections, as some predict - one of the last in the history of France.\n\nThe first choice is the Francis Movement, which is led by Marcel Bucard. It is a movement inspired by the conquests of Charlemagne, the Latin heritage of the Roman Empire and the Italian nationalism of Benito Mussolini. It is extremely militaristic, totalitarian, despotic and conservative compared to the rest. It believes in the supremacy of the "Latin race", and that the French are the most important nation of this race, the heirs of the Roman Empire and the leaders of the entire European civilization. They believe that the "savage Germans and Anglo-Saxons" should submit to them or be annihilated, as well as the Slavs and other peoples of Europe.\n\nThe second is the French Popular Party led by Jacques Doriot, which sympathizes with Marcel Déat and his National Popular Rally. Both Doriot and Déat were former radicals who were excommunicated for their right-wing attitude. Doriot for his French nationalism, and Déat for his pan-European supremacism. Both are for the eradication of secret creatures in France, the removal of unwanted minorities, including the Jews, who are supposedly secretly harming France, including by bringing the Bonapartes to power. They are extreme militarists who believe in Darwinian rule by the strong, reject religion, and believe that anyone should be able to make the ultimate sacrifice for the state. The difference between them is Déat's more left-wing approach to workers' rights and unions (although Doriot's approach is already considered strongly left-wing), and Marcel's pan-European ideas.\n\nThe third option is the French Social Party led by François de La Rocque. He believes in moderate, limited democracy, partial emancipation of women, social, Christian corporatism, and building national identity on language and culture, not race.\n\nThe fourth and final option is the Fire Movement, led by Maurice Delaunay. This is a movement that believes that Delaunay, as the Master of Fire, named François-Henry Prométhée, is the savior of France, just as the Oriflamme saved Paris from the Vikings in the 9th century AD. He believes that new times are coming, so new methods and new people are needed. Not everyone knows what this means, because he often speaks in verse. He believes that Freemasonry must be eradicated and France brought to new glory."

The Second Republic French has been proclaimed, and there is chaos in Paris due to the struggle for power. Lawlessness already prevails in Paris, but will it also take over all of France?

The main role is played by Doriot, who plans to introduce full atheism, fight the "global Masonic-Jewish conspiracy", and fully eradicate the remnants of decadent democrats and the rotten international left.

He has no plans to restore the parliament, but he does plan to introduce Catholicism into the French national identity based on language and culture, not race.

So far, he has spread the claims that his real name is François-Henry Prométhée, he is the Master of Fire whom God sent to save France. His details regarding reforms and governance are not known because he does not speak on the subject or he speaks so poetically that it is impossible to understand him.

Looks like France will move towards the left, introducing a much more radical economy and putting emphasis on a pan-European national and workers' revolution.

He is guided by cosmopolitanism and internationalism. This is the second most libertarian option after anarchists.\n\nAnarchist and Communist Federation led by Sébastien Faure stands against the rest of the anarchist circles by promoting anarchism of synthesis instead of platformism - he seeks to unite all strands of radicalism into one rather than their alliance in anarchism. In contrast to Faure is Émile Armand, who is a total anarcho-egoist who destroys all the foundations of the state.\n\nThe third option is the French Communist Party, which is led by Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos. While the French Section of Workers' Internationale is led by cosmopolitanism, pacifism and liberalism, the communists are led by French patriotism, militarism and totalitarianism. Despite this, they are able to get along well with foreign radicals.\n\nThe final option is the small but controversial Proudhon Circle. Although it took its name from a French anarchist, it has little to do with anarchism. The despotic circle of national socialists led by Georges Valois, who collaborated with many French nationalists, and even French Action and Charles Maurras himself, is based on nationalism and racism, centrally planned economics and social Darwinism. They are said to have had many contacts with many monarchists, both those from Louisiana and the Bonapartists. Many accuse them of double treason, but they have the support of many secret monarchists and nationalists.\n\nThe elections will be held by secret, equal vote of all French citizens.

Nobody knows how he won despite having almost zero popularity. Many believe he cheated. Many disagree with his views. Many want him gone...can't let that happen.\n\nOne of his main enemies are all branches of the Abrahamic church - they promote that he is not God's Prophet, but some Jesus or Muhammad, or that even the Prophet has not arrived yet. Abusrd! Maurice gathered anti-clericals from all over France and used them to vandalize churches and other religious sites throughout France. Many churches burned down, many priests and nuns died. At the same time, many leading representatives of the Abrahamic religions were arrested and publicly tried in Paris. Since the Great French Revolution, French citizens have not been very supportive of any faith, but the majority of believers are Catholic.

Now he has taken power and has a task: to regenerate France using the wisdom of Allah. Guénon and his views were quite balanced for some time, neither conservative nor radical, but the longer he saw the helplessness of the Freemasons, Theosophists, Wahhabists and Salafists, the more he was convinced that "half-measures" were not enough - one had to act, and to act extremely.\n\nIn order to "fix" France, one had to create a new faith for it, a new moral system, a new identity! Based on Islam, or more precisely Sufism, but also with a combination of other religions. The new system that he would find in this religion had to be anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian. Just as René had previously believed that "priestly" and "imperial" power should be separated, he now believes that they should be united - this is an exceptional means to stop France from falling deeper into Kali Yuga - the Iron Age, and modernity - the kingdom of illusion.\n\nRené Guénon himself was once a student of Papus, but he noticed the falsehood of Theosophy, Freemasonry and Martinists. However, he knows that somewhere deep down there is something correct in these beliefs... just like in all beliefs: Taoism, Celtic paganism, Hinduism or Christianity.

After the Great War, Guénon left the lodge and began teaching at a school in Algeria, which accelerated his path to Islam. He is certain of several things about the Freemasons: their rituals are false, their actions are an illusion of what they want to be, and their ideologies are leftist, egalitarian and democratic, which ultimately leads to the collapse of civilization. That is why he stood against them and defeated them together with his former master, who also turned against them.

Together with Guénon, the son of the village chief Nguyen Van Cang also returned to France and continued to teach him Taoism. René noticed that Taoism had many similarities with Islam and Hinduism: Tao is the equivalent of Brahman and Al-Haqq or Zhenren is the equivalent of Guru or Sufi Sheikh.

As a result of the impending invasion, their former dynasty of Braganza family transferred its court to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where it still resides there today. In return, Portugal, after some time of occupation and rejection of the division into a few smaller principalities, was restored to the maps as our vassal with the House of Bourbon-Parma as kings. The House of Bourbon-Parma, despite its blood ties with the Bourbon dynasty, which is hostile to the Bonapartes, was and is a dynasty that is rather willing to cooperate with the dynasty from France, as it was during the wars of the early 19th century.\n\nSince then, peace reigned in Portugal, and it slowly gained independence diplomatically. An important event was the Spanish War of Independence, during which also they declared independence, but we did not declare war on them, so they did not send any troops to the Spanish-French front or support Spain in any way. Many Spaniards hold it against us to this day, but in the end it was good for them, because after re-enslaving Spain, our Emperor only demanded to join their military and economic sphere, not subjection, to which the then King Carlos I agreed. He was liked by the Bonaparte family, because he was the one who gained the throne of Portugal in 1815. Since those events Portugal has distanced itself from the our sphere, effectively but slowly removing our influence in our country.\n\nIn May 1936 Portugal was a monarchy under Elias I of the Bourbon-Parma dynasty.

Almost...\n\nOur intelligence has contacted the remnants of Satanists and they have agreed to recognize our Prophet as the incarnation of Lucifer - Prometheus, who brings the light of freedom for the French from the power of foreign nations and the despotic commands of God. The Prophet has decided that the main organizer of the new, now fully official, Promethean-Satanic National Church of the French Fire will be Marcel Petiot - a serial killer who during the purges and before secretly murdered Jews, posing as a doctor offering them shelter, help and treatment. Over 200 Jews were murdered. Many people consider this impressive and for this reason he was appointed to this position. In the nearest future the Prophet and the priest Petiot are to meet and our Savior will pass on to the chief priest how prayers, cult of Oriflamme, official public black masses, orgies, public executions like burning at the stake, new art, architecture and literature are to look like. The executioners and the avant-garde can rejoice, because their work will now gain much publicity."

 deluge_france_lore.19.d:0 "The leader of France, Maurice Delaunay, made many enemies by completely purging the opposition, but also ordinary people who did not suit him. For this reason, the Masons had to try to kill him, but they failed - he survived. After introducing many reforms, after many purges of secret societies and total indoctrination of the entire population of France, Delaunay still needed an ally - they became Satanists. It has just been announced that the new official church in the FRA is the Promethean-Satanic National Church of the French Fire, whose head priest, appointed by Delaunay, is Marcel Petiot - a serial killer who has killed over 200 Jews in recent years. Now in the ruins of churches will begin black masses, orgies, tortures and public executions, and all this for the glory of France, the Oriflamme and the Prophet."

 deluge_france_foreign.18.d:0 "Recently, there have been visible French diplomatic efforts in our direction. They are clearly trying to improve their image, but to what end? So that we will remain in their sphere or so that we will be more willing to submit?\n\nRelations between France and our country came to a low when in 1807, we refused French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's demand to accede to the Continental System of embargo against the United Kingdom. Soon afterwards, a French invasion under General Jean-Andoche Junot followed, and the our capital of Lisbon was captured on 8 December 1807. As a result of the impending French invasion, our former dynasty Braganza family transferred its court to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where it still resides there today. In return, our country, after some time of French occupation and rejection of the division into a few smaller principalities, was restored to the maps as a French vassal with the House of Bourbon-Parma as kings. The House of Bourbon-Parma, despite its blood ties with the Bourbon dynasty, which is hostile to the Bonapartes, was and is a dynasty that is rather willing to cooperate with the dynasty from France, as it was during the wars of the early 19th century.\n\nSince then, peace reigned in our country, and we slowly gained independence diplomatically. An important event was the Spanish War of Independence, during which we also declared independence, but France did not declare war on us, so we did not send any troops to the Spanish-French front or support Spain in any way. Many Spaniards hold it against us to this day, but in the end it was good for us, because after re-enslaving Spain, France only demanded to join their military and economic sphere, not subjection, to which the then King Carlos I agreed. He was liked by the Bonaparte family, because he was the one who gained the throne of Portugal in 1815. Since those events we have distanced ourselves from the French sphere, effectively but slowly removing French influence in our country. However, does France still want us to be only their partners and not their subjects?"
