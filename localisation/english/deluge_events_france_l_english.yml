 deluge_france.1.t:0 "May Day"
 deluge_france.1.d:0 "The first of May has been a day of solidarity for labour movements around the world since 1851, when an unruly mob of striking Parisian textile workers were justly brought to order by gendarmes. It has also been a day of apprehension for the ruling classes since 1866, when strikes turned to revolution and kings fled from their palaces in fear. No sovereign wishes to see a return to those chaotic days, so the Paris parade was heavily vetted and controlled by police. We pray there will be no disturbances.\n\nBut we cannot pray forever, changes are needed right now. Society is feverish from the ongoing crisis of financial collapse, when the money bubble burst and destroyed the country's stock exchanges with a flood. France needs to be saved, but before we start updating the economy, we need to dot the "I's" and cross the "T's." in our government apparatus. There are some ambitious and determined people who offer their ideas for changing the situation in exchange for some concessions."
 deluge_france.1.a:0 "It can't be that bad..."
 deluge_france.2.t:0 "French May Day Passes Uneventfully"
 deluge_france.2.d:0 "The ruling classes of the world have breathed a sigh of relief today, as the tension surrounding the Paris parades dissipates under the rays of the new dawn. While the flames of revolution may still be roaring in Germany, the French masses are apparently too subdued by the recent horrors of the Great War to make trouble.\n\nAt least, for now, because the French economy remains crushed after the recent financial collapse and no one can predict how the popular unrest will end."
 deluge_france.2.a:0 "Eternal solidarity!"
 deluge_france.2.b:0 "A troubling time."
 deluge_france.2.c:0 "It was a time of great evil."
 deluge_france.2.e:0 "We must remain vigilant for traitors."
 deluge_france.3.t:0 "Strikes!"
 deluge_france.3.d:0 "After recent devaluation of the Franc many people get into bad economic situation, especially lower-class workers, who are striking now. Combined with the Great Depression situation only gets worse."
 deluge_france.3.a:0 "We have to deal with them somehow..."
 deluge_france.4.t:0 "Boulangists Coup!"
 deluge_france.4.d:0 "In order to gain absolute power, the emperor proposed the cooperation of some former members of the French Action, such as Henri Vaugeois, who did not run away to support Louisiana after the Great War. Today, his efforts have culminated in the introduction of reforms that effectively remove any government role in state affairs, turning it into more of a council designed solely to advise the emperor.\n\nHowever, despite gaining absolute power, one more obstacle appeared in the emperor's way - a military coup! Today, high-ranking military men calling themselves Bulangists entered the emperor's palace and want to force him to hand over power to them by force of firearms.\n\nThe Bulangists are a group of military men with extreme right-wing and revanchist views. They were inspired by Georges Ernest Boulanger, the Minister of War, who took this office after 1866, when riots broke out in the country, the central government and the army were distracted from their duties, thanks to which the Netherlands and Italy were able to win their independence with the help of the British. At the same time, Spain tried to become independent from our empire, but despite the indirect support of Louisiana it failed. Bulangists strive for a revanchist foreign policy, aimed at restoring France's position as the European hegemon and then taking over the rest of the world. In addition, they want to restore the agrarian lifestyle, deal with minorities, full patriarchy and militarization of the state.\n\nThe main commanders of the coup are Louis Franchet d’Espérey and Maxime Weygand. In this situation, the emperor has no choice but to try to convince them that he will pursue their revanchist ideas. If he fails he will become their puppet."
 deluge_france.4.a:0 "The Emperor convinces them that he will pursue the same goals as them."
 deluge_france.4.b:0 "The Emperor gives in."
 deluge_france.5.t:0 "Question of leadership..."
 deluge_france.5.d:0 "Current leader of Boulangists is Louis Franchet d'Espérey, however many say he is too old to hold this position. Another candidate many believe is suitable is Maxime Weygand. If Maxime convinces enough people, he will be able to force Louis Franchet d'Esperey to resign."
 deluge_france.5.a:0 "Maxime Weygand to decides to do nothing."
 deluge_france.5.b:0 "Maxime Weygand forces d'Espérey to resign." 
 
 deluge_france27title: "Libyan Revolution Succesful"
 deluge_france27desc: "In a historic turn of events following prolonged unrest in the Libyan colony, the Local Senussi Order has successfully overcome the forces of the French Empire, heralding a newfound era of independence for the people of Libya. This significant development marks a triumph for the Libyan populace and underscores the resilience of the Local Senussi Order in the face of adversity. The world watches as Libya takes its place on the global stage, forging its path towards autonomy and self-determination."
 deluge_france27opta: "Ok"
 deluge_france27optb: "Mon Dieu"
 deluge_france27optc: "Ey Ya Watan"

 deluge_france28title: "Libyan Revolution Crushed"
 deluge_france28desc: "In an anticipated twist of events amid enduring unrest in the Libyan colony, the Local Senussi Order has fallen short in its bid to overcome the forces of the French Empire, perpetuating the era of colonialism for the people of Libya. This noteworthy development signals a success for the French Empire and challenges the perceived resilience of the Local Senussi Order in the face of adversity. The global community observes as France reaffirms its position on the world stage, paving the way for a new chapter in French Imperialism.."
 deluge_france28opta: "Ok"

 deluge_france.28.title: "Louisiana Accepts"
 deluge_france.28.desc: "We managed to convince New Orleans that restoring relations with us would be beneficial for both powers. We are already choosing a place in the capital for the Louisiana embassy and are assembling a working group to send to America."
 deluge_france.28.a: "Because we are all French!"
 
 deluge_france.29.title: "Louisiana Refuses"
 deluge_france.29.desc: "The Louisiana authorities referred to the fact that by this attempt to cooperate, we are only continuing the destructive policy of subjugating peoples. Their negotiators say that common roots don't matter when one side wants to dominate the other."
 deluge_france.29.a: "We did not really want to."
 
 deluge_france.30.title: "The Royal Ultimatum"
 deluge_france.30.desc: "A response was received from Louisiana, the seriousness of which we doubt. They claim that dialogue is possible only if the French Empire abandons its main doctrine - they hint at the return of the king! If our side invites the king to rule, they say, then only in this case we can all count on a future together."
 deluge_france.30.a: "Long live the King!"
 deluge_france.30.b: "No is no."
