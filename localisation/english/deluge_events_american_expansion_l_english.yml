 american_expansion1title: "America Claims Quebec"
 american_expansion1desc: "Revanchist political rallies in [From.GetNameDef] have been held for several months now, as [From.GetLeader] stirs up popular support for a war against the Quebecois. Claiming that the recent history of radicalism and revolution in the country has rendered Quebec a 'failed state', [From.GetAdjective] propagandists are creating a popular case for war. The [From.GetAdjective] army is believed to be fully mobilised to press the claim by force."
 american_expansion1opta: "To victory!"
 american_expansion1optb: "Bastards!"
 american_expansion1optc: "Concerning."
 american_expansion2title: "America Claims Louisiana"
 american_expansion2desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has issued a terse statement to the effect that the presence of the Louisianan state on the Western Hemisphere is unacceptable to the [From.GetAdjective] government. Why they have chosen now to issue this proclamation is unknown, but it has left the government in New Orleans shocked and angry. The [From.GetAdjective] army is believed to be fully mobilised to press the claim by force."
 american_expansion2opta: "To victory!"
 american_expansion2optb: "Bastards!"
 american_expansion2optc: "Concerning."
 american_expansion3title: "America Claims Deseret"
 american_expansion3desc: "Religious and political figures in [From.GetNameDef] have been dredging up old horror stories about the sinful way of life the Mormons in Deseret pursue. [From.GetAdjective] foreign policy appears to be taking a turn towards revanchism and expansionism, and America's armed forces are mobilising."
 american_expansion3opta: "To victory!"
 american_expansion3optb: "Bastards!"
 american_expansion3optc: "Concerning."
 american_expansion4title: "America Claims the Far North"
 american_expansion4desc: "Revanchist political rallies in [From.GetNameDef] have been held for several months now, as [From.GetLeader] stirs up popular support for a war against the Algonquian nation. [From.GetAdjective] propaganda denounces the Algonquian state as an uncivilised relic of the colonial era that should be swept away. The [From.GetAdjective] army is believed to be fully mobilised to press the claim by force."
 american_expansion4opta: "To victory!"
 american_expansion4optb: "Bastards!"
 american_expansion4optc: "Concerning."
 american_expansion5title: "America a Radical Republic"
 american_expansion5desc: "[From.GetLeader] has announced the formation of [From.GetNameDef] as the legal successor of the American kingdom. Drawing justification from her brief history as a republic during the Revolutionary War, the new system has abolished all titles of nobility and the legal privileges that went with them. Many old dynasties, including the House of Hamilton, are fleeing into exile as their lands and assets are being seized by the state for redistribution. The former king has begged the monarchies of the Old World to 'save his country from the tyranny of the mob', but such an outcome seems unlikely."
 american_expansion5opta: "The star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave!"
 american_expansion5optb: "Solidarity to President [From.GetLeader]."
 american_expansion5optc: "A meaningless change of name for the same anarchic tyranny of the majority."
 american_expansion5optd: "Terrible. [From.GetLeader] has deposed the custodian of the American people."
 american_expansion5opte: "The American people deserve a stronger ruler than this fool."
 american_expansion6title: "American Republic Created"
 american_expansion6desc: "[From.GetLeader] has announced the formation of [From.GetNameDef] as the legal successor of the American kingdom. Drawing justification from her brief history as a republic during the Revolutionary War, the new system has abolished all titles of nobility and the legal privileges that went with them. A constitutional convention has convened to draw up the rules by which the new government will function, and it is believed that more power will be given to the states to weaken the central government, and to the judiciary and legislature at the expense of the executive. The former king has protested his deposition as an illegal coup, although whether anyone will take up arms in defence of his claim remains to be seen."
 american_expansion6opta: "The star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave!"
 american_expansion6optb: "The bourgeoisie have stripped away the illusion and revealed their open exploitation."
 american_expansion6optc: "Inspiring! Congratulations, President [From.GetLeader]!"
 american_expansion6optd: "Terrible. [From.GetLeader] has deposed the custodian of the American people."
 american_expansion6opte: "A government of weaklings."
 american_expansion7title: "American Republic Created"
 american_expansion7desc: "[From.GetLeader] has announced the formation of [From.GetNameDef] as the legal successor of the American kingdom. Drawing justification from her brief history as a republic during the Revolutionary War, the ultranationalist state has declared that the former king was unable to protect the American people from radicalism and was standing in the way of 'national revival'. The strong powers of the federal monarchy have been legally transferred to the new office of President, and though there is some clamour from the Southern states to re-establish slavery (only formally abolished in 1895), no great changes to the relationship between the states and the federal government are expected. The former king has fled the country in fear of his life."
 american_expansion7opta: "The star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave!"
 american_expansion7optb: "The bourgeoisie have stripped away the illusion and revealed their brutal exploitation."
 american_expansion7optc: "A meaningless change of name for the same brutal tyranny."
 american_expansion7optd: "Terrible. [From.GetLeader] has deposed the custodian of the American people."
 american_expansion7opte: "Congratulations, President [From.GetLeader]!"
 american_expansion8title: "Turmoil in the South"
 american_expansion8desc: "Reports from state governments and Federal military units in the Southern states are pouring in. According to the confused and sometimes contradictory reports, an unknown force has been storming Federal government buildings, seizing Army stockpiles and setting up road blocks on important transit routes. Army units in the middle of schedueled exercises have been surprised and disarmed by the sudden attack. The units are retreating to safety, although casualties remain low."
 american_expansion8opt: "What the Devil is going on down there?"
 american_expansion9title: "Black and Red Rebellion"
 american_expansion9desc: "The nature of the disturbance gripping Georgia and the Carolinas has now been established. Armed bands belonging to militant far-left groups are attempting to expel Federal forces, and in most cases have been successful. The stockpiles of arms seized have been distributed and the rag-tag insurgency has grown into a large rebellion.\n\nRebel forces have issued demands to the Federal government: revoke the Jim Crow laws and allow their militias to enforce the peace in the South, or face a civil war."
 american_expansion9opta: "We can accept some of these demands, but the Federal government will remain in control."
 american_expansion9optb: "We don't negotiate with terrorists."
 american_expansion9optc: "Their cause is just. Let the [Root.GetRulingParty] tyrants tremble!"
 american_expansion10title: "Unrest in America"
 american_expansion10desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has been rocked by a series of protests and riots culminating in an armed uprising by far-left opponents of the government. A short-lived rebellion took place under the banner of the 'Congaree Socialist Republic', uniting Radicals, Republicans and Black Nationalists.\n\n[From.GetLeader] was able to negotiate an end to the turmoil before it descended into civil war. One of the demands the [From.GetRulingParty] government agreed to was the end of the 'Jim Crow' laws, a system of official discrimination aimed against the African-American minority."
 american_expansion10opta: "We're all Americans now."
 american_expansion10optb: "'An armed citizenry is the first defence, the best defence, and the final defence against tyranny.'"
 american_expansion10optc: "They should have elected better representatives, violence only delegitimises their demands."

 american_expansion10opte: "Coward! You give the Reds an inch and they'll take a mile!"
 american_expansion11title: "Rebellion in America"
 american_expansion11desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has been rocked by a series of protests and riots culminating in an armed uprising by far-left opponents of the government. The banner of the 'Congaree Socialist Republic' now flies over Georgia and the Carolinas, uniting Radicals, Republicans and Black Nationalists against the government of [From.GetLeader].\n\nOne of the primary demands of the rebels is for the [From.GetRulingParty] to abolish the 'Jim Crow' laws, a system of official discrimination aimed against the African-American minority. The official response has been to 'refuse to negotiate with terrorists'."
 american_expansion11opta: "Traitors."
 american_expansion11optb: "Death to the tyrants!"
 american_expansion11optc: "'An armed citizenry is the first defence, the best defence, and the final defence against tyranny.'"
