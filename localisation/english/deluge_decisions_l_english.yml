 seek_enemies_category:0 "Vicious Enemy"
 seek_enemies_category_desc:0 "The Great War and the Peace of Versailles were a great humiliation for our country. Pomorze was lost, the army was significantly reduced, the economy turned into ruins and the political system became unstable. Thanks to Marshal Piłsudski, we have coped with all internal problems, but there is something else — even though the Marshal has died, but his dream of revenge on the French is achievable and shared by the people. So let's do its embodiment!"

 army_reform_category:0 "Military Reform"
 army_reform_category_desc:0 "At the moment, our armed forces are divided into two camps. The Polish Military Organization is a secret association of military leaders who helped us get rid of French influence. Later, when Poland gained independence, they sabotaged the actions of radicals in the country to prevent a revolution. Because of this, the PMO has become very powerful and wants to dominate the high command. They consider themselves the elite of the army and want their opinion to play a decisive role. It is opposed by the generals of the Polish Military, who want a strong army in which decisions are made by those who are right, and not by those who have a high rank.\n\nThis causes a lot of problems. The army is in desperate need of reform, and we need to solve the problem of the conflict between the PMO and the Polish Military.\n\nMaking decisions, you can increase the strength of one of the parties to the conflict. After one of the parties becomes strong enough, it is possible to resolve the conflict. The winning side will affect the modifiers for the army.\n\nThe influence of the §5POW§!: [?POL_POW_strength] \nThe influence of the §8WP§!: [?POL_WP_strength]"
